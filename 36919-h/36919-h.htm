<h2>PROLOGUE</h2>


<p>The actors in this drama are dead, or else
life has turned them into such different beings
that their transformation is hardly less than
that of death itself. Their thoughts are scattered
to the winds, or live, oddly changed,
in the bodies of their children&mdash;the girl who
brought me the journals and packages of letters
smiled up at me with the flashing smile
of Ellen.</p>

<p>This girl, with a gesture of the hand, opened
for me the gates of the past, and when she was
gone I walked through them with beating heart,
back over the steep path of years. This little
package of long-forgotten papers which she had
given me, and of whose contents she was ignorant,
were a strange legacy, for it was my own
youth that I found in them and the youth of
Ellen.</p>

<p>As I went over the scrawled journals and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>2]</a></span>
through the packages of letters, the land of
memory blossomed for me and the tears that
came to my eyes thawed the ice of many years.
Ellen herself had forgotten her youth; she may
not have remembered that in the bottom of an
old trunk she had left for me things which she
could not bear to destroy&mdash;for there they
found them after her death with a letter addressed
to me. As I read on, it was as though
I had before me the broken pieces of her heart,
and as I looked, my own childhood and even
my girlhood lived again.</p>

<p>I had often looked for my girlhood and had
never found it. Those years when women are
in the making&mdash;that land of glamour&mdash;are the
hardest thing of all for grown-up people to
understand. Nothing stays fixed there, all the
emotions are at their point of effervescence
and their charm is their evanescence. The very
power of early youth is in the violence of its
changes; it is the era of chaos in the souls of
people; when they are in the making; when the
crust is only forming, and the fire may break
forth at any moment; and when what seems
most secure and fixed trembles under the feet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>3]</a></span>
and disappears in some new-made gulf of the
emotions. Then, too, in our youth they teach
us such cruel things, we spend ourselves in
trying to keep alive such spent fires, and no one
tells us that it is anything but noble to live
under the destructive tyranny of love. We
have to find our way alone&mdash;</p>

<p>The thought came to me that I would try
to write a sort of story of my friend. And yet,
although I had before me the picture of a heart
in the making, I have taken up my pen and
laid it down again because it is not a story
which &ldquo;marches.&rdquo; Its victories and defeats
went on in the quiet of Ellen&rsquo;s heart, but I
have learned that this silent making and marring
of the hearts of women means the fate of
all men forever.</p>

<p>I fancy that women will have another bar of
judgment and that the question asked us there
will be: &ldquo;Have you loved well? Were you
small and grudging and niggardly? Did you
make of love a sorry barter, or did you give with
such a gesture as spring makes when it walks
blossoming across the land?&rdquo; I do not think
that old age often repents the generosities of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>4]</a></span>
its youth; perhaps it is my own too careful sowing
that makes me wish to write the life of my
friend, who asked only to spend herself and her
own sweetness with both reckless hands.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>


<p>Ellen and her mother drove in a &ldquo;shay&rdquo;
to take possession of the old Scudder house,
which had been vacant long enough to have
a deserted and haunted look. It was far back
from the street and was sentineled on either
side by an uncompromising fir tree. Great
vans, of the kind used in that early day to move
furniture from one town to another, disgorged
their contents on the young spring grass, and
though Mildred Dilloway and Janie Acres and
I walked to the village store and back on a
half-dozen errands, we saw nothing of the new
little girl that day; but there remains in my
mind the memory of her little mother, a youthful,
black-clad figure, moving helplessly, and
it seemed at random, among her household
effects that squatted so forlornly in the front
yard and then started on their processional
walk to the house, impelled by the puissant
force of Miss Sarah Grant.</p>

<p>Ellen&rsquo;s account of this time is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>6]</a></span>
&ldquo;We are going to live by ourselves, though
we can&rsquo;t afford it, because we are ourselves,
mamma says, and will really give less trouble
this way, though my aunt and uncle think not.
&lsquo;I want you to win your aunt and uncle,&rsquo; she
said to me. It will be so much easier for me
to win them if they don&rsquo;t know me too well.
That is one of her reasons for not living in
the house with them. &lsquo;They would find us so
slack that we should become a thorn in their
flesh.&rsquo; &lsquo;Couldn&rsquo;t we stop being slack?&rsquo; I said.
Mamma looked at me, and after a long time
she said, &lsquo;You and I, Ellen, will always be slack
inside. Material things don&rsquo;t interest us.&rsquo; My
mother doesn&rsquo;t know me. I like some material
things, like ploughing. I said to her: &lsquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t
<em>they</em> be a thorn in <em>our</em> flesh?&rsquo; She tried not to
smile, and said quite sternly: &lsquo;Ellen, you must
never think of your dear aunt and uncle in that
way.&rsquo; If it is so, why shouldn&rsquo;t I think so, I
wonder? As soon as I saw them I knew what
mother meant. They are very nice and I love
them, but they have never leaned over the gate
to talk to peddlers. A lost dog wouldn&rsquo;t be
happy in their home. We have never had any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>7]</a></span>
dogs but lost ones. And Aunt Sarah didn&rsquo;t like
Faro&rsquo;s name or his ways. I like Aunt Sarah.
She says just what she feels like saying. Mother
doesn&rsquo;t. Mother says the things she wants
to feel like saying. I annoyed my Aunt Sarah
by forgetting to come home to help, and mother
said, &lsquo;Oh, dear, why did you need to go and
read the Bible to that woman next door when
we were moving in, and I wanted your aunt to
have a high opinion of you?&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;She had
the rheumatism.&rsquo; Aunt Sarah said, &lsquo;Does she
read with her knee; and how came you there
anyway, Ellen?&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;By the back door,
because I like back doors and I hate going
in front doors.&rsquo; Aunt Sarah looked at me very
sharply and said, &lsquo;That child of yours, Emily,
is just such a child as I should expect you to
have, reading the Bible to strangers who have
the rheumatism when a pair of willing hands
would have been useful at home.&rsquo; The way she
looked at me, I knew deep inside she didn&rsquo;t
really mind, so I suddenly kissed her. Later
mother said, &lsquo;Mercy! I would never have dared
to kiss your Aunt Sarah like that.&rsquo; I told her
I knew Aunt Sarah wanted me to. &lsquo;How can
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>8]</a></span>
you tell?&rsquo; asked mother; but I always know
things like that. It makes me feel rather vain,
and vanity is a sin. My Uncle Ephraim is like
a picture and so is the big house they live in.
I had a moment that mamma called &lsquo;flesh-pottish&rsquo;
and longed to live there. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s
just it, Ellen,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;They are like pictures,
and you and I would be sure to injure their
lovely surfaces. We are not violent, but so
careless.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>After this arduous day I remember Miss
Sarah popped down in my grandmother&rsquo;s sitting-room.
Said she: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m all out of breath.&rdquo;
My grandmother waited for further information.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been settling,&rdquo; Miss Sarah informed her
with that frankness that kept all the older
ladies in town in a state of twittering expectation.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been settling my do-less sister and
her do-less child.&rdquo; She spoke in some exasperation.</p>

<p>My grandmother allowed a long pause and
said reflectively:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d make any one do-less, Sarah.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And, indeed, Miss Sarah Grant was one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>9]</a></span>
of those energetic ladies who leave no place
for the energies of others to expand. But
here the wind shifted and her irritation disappeared.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, my dear,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s too sad.
Those children are as little fit to take care of
themselves and to live alone as young robins
in the nest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Lord looks after such,&rdquo; said my grandmother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; replied Miss Sarah, with asperity,
&ldquo;you may be sure that after what I&rsquo;ve seen of
this world I&rsquo;m not going to leave it with the
Lord.&rdquo; She was on terms of familiarity with
the Deity that even permitted criticism of his
ways. Then she said: &ldquo;Send Roberta soon to
see that poor, fatherless Ellen of mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This my grandmother did, shortly afterwards,
and I started forth on my first visit to the
&ldquo;poor, fatherless Ellen&rdquo; at the slow and elegant
gait of a hearse with plumes. We were not far
removed from that period when young ladies
employed their leisure by limning lachrymose
females weeping over urns. We were therefore
expectant of a certain pomp of mourning; long,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>10]</a></span>
black draperies were the least we demanded.
Ellen, I learned, was in the apple orchard, and
thither I bent my solemn footsteps.</p>

<p>It was in full bloom, one tree after another
looking like bridal nosegays of some beneficent
giant. All was quiet save for the droning of
honey-bees. Suddenly two inches above my
head there burst forth the roars of an infant of
tender years. I looked up and there I beheld
my tragic heroine. Her dress was of blue,
checked gingham, a piece of which was caught
on a twig of the apple tree and rent nearly in a
three-cornered tear. One stocking was coming
down in a manner unbecoming to any girl.
Her hair was plaited in two neat little &ldquo;plats,&rdquo;
as we used to call them, and tied tightly with
meager ribbons; but though I took these things
in at a glance, that which naturally most arrested
my attention was the fact that Ellen
cherished to her bosom a large, red-headed infant,
whom I immediately recognized as being
one of the brood of the prolific Sweeneys.</p>

<p>The child ceased roaring for a moment, upon
which Ellen remarked to me with grave self-composure:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>11]</a></span>
&ldquo;How do you do? I suppose you have come
to play with me, but my brother and I can&rsquo;t
come down for a moment until I have managed
to get my dress from that twig. Perhaps you
could come up and undo it, or if you could perhaps
come and get him&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your brother!&rdquo; I cried. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s one of the
Sweeney children.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ellen&rsquo;s eyes flashed. &ldquo;It <em>is</em> my brother,&rdquo; she
insisted. &ldquo;You can see for yourself it&rsquo;s my
brother. Would one have taken anything but
one&rsquo;s brother up a tree? I have to take care
of him all the time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Said I: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve known the Sweeney boys all my
life; there are seven of them and the third but
one biggest always takes care of the smallest.
There&rsquo;s one littler &rsquo;n this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, there <em>is</em>!&rdquo; said Ellen. Her brow darkened.
&ldquo;And I got up the tree with this large,
hulking thing in my arms&mdash;and goodness
knows how I ever did get up it!&rdquo; She spoke
with vigor and precision.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aha!&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;you say yourself it&rsquo;s a
Sweeney.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say nothing of the kind,&rdquo; rejoined Ellen.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>12]</a></span>
&ldquo;This is my brother. Come,&rdquo; she wheedled,
&ldquo;why won&rsquo;t you say it&rsquo;s my brother?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I bit my lip; I wanted to go, for I was not
used to being made game of. Moreover, I disapproved
of her present position extremely.
There was I, my mouth made up, so to speak,
for a weeping-willow air, lachrymose ringlets,
dark-rimmed eyes, and black raiment, and I
had encountered fallen stockings, torn blue
gingham, and the Sweeney baby, and the whole
of it together up a tree.</p>

<p>Ellen now looked down on me. Her generous
mouth with its tip-tilted corners&mdash;an exotic,
lovable mouth, too large for beauty, but of a
remarkable texture and color&mdash;now drooped
and her eyes filled,&mdash;filled beautifully, and
yet did not brim over. And for all the droop of
the mouth, the saddest little smile I have ever
seen hovered about its corners.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you <em>please</em> say that this is my
brother?&rdquo; she pleaded.</p>

<p>Though I knew it was the Sweeney baby
and though I knew she was play-acting all
of it, stubborn and downright child though
I was, something gripped my heart. Though I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>13]</a></span>
couldn&rsquo;t have then put it into words, there
was a wistfulness and a heart-hunger about
her that played a game with me. It was my
first encounter and my first overthrow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have it your brother,&rdquo; said I in a surly
fashion.</p>

<p>When we had got the baby down from the
tree, Ellen finished me by looking at me with
her sincere, sweet eyes in which there was a hint
of tears, and saying softly: &ldquo;Once I had a little
brother who died.&rdquo; That was all. She turned
her face away; I turned my face away; our
hands met. It was as though she was explaining
to me her insistence on the Sweeney baby.</p>

<p>It was her look and this silent and averted
hand-clasp that brought me to my feet in a very
torrent of feeling when Alec Yorke, an engaging
youth of eleven summers, came ramping
through the orchard shouting:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;ll get it! You&rsquo;ll get it! Mrs.
Sweeney&rsquo;s given Ted a good one already&mdash;she&rsquo;s
after you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was not the gusto in his tone at her ultimate
fate that irritated me, but this taking
away of Ellen&rsquo;s baby brother.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>14]</a></span>
&ldquo;Mrs. Sweeney&rsquo;s got nothing to do with this
baby!&rdquo; I cried. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Ellen&rsquo;s brother!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I bent down and picked up a stone and
threw it at Alec. Ellen did the same. In one
second we had performed one of those amazing
sleights of hand that are so frequent and so disconcerting
at this moment of girlhood. A moment
before we had been swimming along the
upper levels of sentiment and crossing the tender,
heart-breaking line of the love of women
for little children; now our teary mistiness vanished
and we were back at the green-apple-hearted
moment of childhood. That afternoon
I had already been a young lady with all the
decorous manners of eighteen; I had been no
age,&mdash;just a woman whose heart is touched
with pity and affection; and now I was just
stern, hard twelve, and I threw a rock at my
little friend, Alec Yorke. So did Ellen.</p>

<p>Together, with hoots and pebbles, we drove
the invading male from our midst. Ellen, I
remember, had a &ldquo;Yip! Yip! Yip!&rdquo; which was
blood-thirsty and derisive at once. She barked
it out like a terrier gone mad. I remember
also her crying out in a ferocious agony of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>15]</a></span>
desire: &ldquo;Oh, if I get near you, won&rsquo;t I <em>spit</em> on
you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>These were her first words to Alec. He said
in later years that their first meeting was indelibly
engraven on his memory. He retreated
over the fence vanquished by superior force,
but with his head well up and his thumb to his
gallantly tilted nose. Here Ellen turned to me,
the light of victory flashing from her eyes, which
fought with my interrogatory gaze, filled with
tears again, and at last sought the distance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>I never had a little brother</em>,&rdquo; she muttered
thickly.</p>

<p>Anger surged over me and then died as
quickly as it had come. Again she had me.
The quiver in her voice showed me what her
sincerity had cost her, and so did her next
words:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wanted one so always that I just had to
make-believe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here one had the heart of truth, stripped of
the spirit of make-believe which it had clothed
in quaint and absurd garments. Again I
squeezed Ellen&rsquo;s hand in mine.</p>

<p>I tell all these things in detail because this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>16]</a></span>
was so Ellen. She had this dual nature which
fought forever in her heart,&mdash;the passion for
make-believe and the fundamental need of telling
the truth,&mdash;always to herself, and often
embarrassingly to those she loved.</p>

<p>She comments as follows on this episode, unconsciously
showing me as the young prig I
was:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;The moment Roberta picked up a rock to
fight for my brother, I knew I should have to tell
her the truth. I saw right away how good Roberta
was. She has very lovely blue eyes and
her hair is so smooth and shiny that I don&rsquo;t believe
she musses it when she sleeps. She looked
at me so straight and her eyes were so round
that it was very hard work to tell her that the
Sweeney baby was not my brother, but I gritted
my teeth and did it. The rest was easy on account
of her soft heart.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>


<p>The heart of man is mysterious. Why a
passionately expressed desire to spit upon one
should be alluring, God knows&mdash;I don&rsquo;t. It
was fatal to Alec. I see him now jumping up
and down outside the fence, shouting forth:
&ldquo;Ya ha! Ya ha! You can&rsquo;t get me!&rdquo;&mdash;or
wooing Ellen by the subtle method of attaching
a hard green apple to a supple stick and flinging
it at her. The relations of these two, as
you can see, were deep from the first.</p>

<p>Ellen, more than any of the rest of us, had
sharp recrudescences back to little girlhood
just as she flamed further ahead on the shimmering
path of adolescence. Thus she covered
a wide gamut of years in her everyday life.
I think it is this ability to roam up and down
time that makes life interesting, more than
any other thing.</p>

<p>So when Janie Acres and Mildred Dilloway
and Ellen and I would be sitting under the
trees discussing the important affairs of life,
Ellen would suddenly be moved to arise with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>18]</a></span>
her ear-rending &ldquo;Yip! Yip!&rdquo; and &ldquo;career&rdquo;
(I use Miss Sarah&rsquo;s word) across the landscape.
Her frocks, because of her mother&rsquo;s dislike to
the dull work of letting down tucks and hems,
were shorter than those worn in my decorous
young days, and her thin little legs measured
the distance like a pair of dividers. There was
an intensity to her flight that made one think
of a projectile.</p>

<p>From the excursions into tenderness that
our little quartette of girls was always making,
from our sudden flashes of maturity, Ellen
would suddenly leap with both feet into full
childhood. I remember sudden jumps from
high lofts and swinging from trees and the
slipping off of shoes and stockings for the purpose
of wading in brooks. And these impassioned
returns to the golden age were always
heightened by the presence of Alec. Such &ldquo;performances&rdquo;
were, of course, severely criticized.
New England at that time was staider than it
is to-day; a higher standard of what was named
&ldquo;decorum&rdquo; was demanded of the young, and
yet smiles flickered around mouths while brows
frowned when Ellen played.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>19]</a></span>
As I read Ellen&rsquo;s journal at this time, it is
as though I could see her growing up as the
tide comes in; the receding wave toward childhood
meant Alec to her. He was a loosely
built lad with a humorous and smiling mouth.
His shaggy mane of hair, which boys wore
longer in those days than they do now, gave
him the appearance of a lion&rsquo;s cub. His whimsical
temperament and his easy disposition he
got from his mother. She was a placid woman
who had spent her life in adapting herself to
the difficult temperament of Mr. Yorke, and
it was her boast that there was no other woman
living who could have got on with her husband
without being fidgeted into an early grave.
When Miss Sarah opined that if she put her
mind on that and on nothing else, she could
get on with any man living, Mrs. Yorke replied
nothing, but said afterwards to my grandmother:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor Miss Sarah! Ain&rsquo;t it queer about
these unmarried women; no matter how intellectual
they be! It ain&rsquo;t puttin&rsquo; your mind on
it ever made a woman get on with the man she&rsquo;s
married to.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>20]</a></span>
Whatever the knack was that made a woman
accomplish this feat, Alec had had imparted by
his mother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Learnin&rsquo; you to get on with your pa real
easy an&rsquo; smilin&rsquo; is goin&rsquo; to help you a lot in
life, Alec,&rdquo; the good woman had told her son.
&ldquo;Mebbe it&rsquo;ll be worth more to you than as if
we had money to leave you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Understanding the virtues in a good but
crotchety and trying man, had bred in Alec a
tolerant and humorous spirit of the kind that
most people don&rsquo;t ever acquire at all, and that
Youth seldom knows. It made him kind to
boys younger than himself, and also made it
easy for his mother to make him play the part
of nurse to smaller brothers and sisters and
also to nieces and nephews, for Mrs. Yorke&rsquo;s
married sister lived next door to her. It was
the constant presence of a small child in Alec&rsquo;s
train that made Ellen discover the mystery
about him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a deep mystery about Alec,&rdquo; Ellen
told me. &ldquo;Every day he comes and leaves his
baby with me at a certain time and runs off
rapidly toward the Butlers&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>21]</a></span>
Now I had seen Alec Yorke grow up; he was
younger than I, and you know the scorn that
a girl of thirteen can have toward a boy a year
her junior and half a head shorter than she.
At that time he fits into no scheme of things;
there is no being on earth who arouses one&rsquo;s
sentiment less. As a sweetheart he is impossible;
equally impossible is he as an object on
which to lavish motherly feelings. For me,
Alec was a mere plague; he lured Ellen from
me into skylarkings in which I had no part,
nor did I wish to have, having, by the New
England training of that day, already had my
childhood taken from me. It was not mystery
that I had ever connected with Alec, but a
baffling sense of humor and an intensity in
the way he could turn hand-springs. There
was a fire in his performance of cart-wheels
that seemed to let loose all that was foolish and
gay, and, from the point of view of the grown-ups
of the time, reprehensible in Ellen. So it
was obvious to me that any mysterious doings
of Alec&rsquo;s meant no good.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We ought to find out,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;what he&rsquo;s
about.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>22]</a></span>
&ldquo;Oh, Roberta!&rdquo; pleaded Ellen; &ldquo;then it
wouldn&rsquo;t be a mystery any more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We ought to find out what he&rsquo;s doing,&rdquo;
I pursued, &ldquo;and get him to stop it. We should
use our influence even if he is young.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We, therefore, stealthily made after Alec.
He went out through a hole in the fence of the
Scudder place, circled a little wood, scaled
some outhouses of the Jones&rsquo;s, and in this
circuitous method came back to old Mrs.
Butler&rsquo;s, next door, and there he lay on his
stomach in the woodshed, at a little distance.
With a reappearance of guilty stealth, he looked
around and seeing no one he dove suddenly
into Mrs. Butler&rsquo;s house. Mrs. Butler was
stricken with rheumatism and lived entirely
on the first floor, so by the simple method of
flattening our noses against the window-pane
we might find out anything that was afoot.
We fathomed the mystery. There stood Alec,
doing old Mrs. Butler&rsquo;s back hair. He combed
it out as best he might, while she punctuated
the performance with such remarks as these:
&ldquo;Lor! child, remember it&rsquo;s hair in your hands,
not a hank of yarn.&rdquo; Then she would groan,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>23]</a></span>
&ldquo;Oh, the day that I lost the use of my arms
over my head and must go through this!&rdquo; All
of which Alec bore with patience.</p>

<p>We made off a little shamefacedly while
Ellen hissed in my ear, with fine logic: &ldquo;There,
Roberta Hathaway, that&rsquo;s what you get by
snooping into people&rsquo;s business.&rdquo; We never
mentioned Alec&rsquo;s mystery to him, though from
time to time Ellen would seem maddeningly
knowing.</p>




<p class="padtop"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>24]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>


<p>When Mrs. Payne had been in our village
less than a year and the interest of the village
in the &ldquo;do-less&rdquo; sister of Miss Sarah had somewhat
dwindled, it flamed up again. Mrs. Payne
had a visitor, to our country eyes a splendid-looking,
middle-aged gentleman. He put up
at the little inn and called on Mrs. Payne and
brought her such little trifles as a man might
bestow upon a lady; sweets also he brought
for Ellen, and a most elegant little needlecase
with a gold thimble,&mdash;an incongruous gift,
for since Ellen learned the use of the needle
she had abhorred it; if she lived to-day she
would have darned her stockings with a sail
needle and dental floss. There went through
the town, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s courting the widow,&rdquo; for
he came again and again, and in the mean
time, according to the postmistress, there arrived
letters and a package or two.</p>

<p>Concerning this episode Ellen writes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;I wish aunts were made of different stuff.
When Aunt Sarah comes down here looking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>25]</a></span>
like a gorgon, I know that she has come to
make my mother cry and I am very glad that
I called her &lsquo;old gorgon-face&rsquo; right before her
one time, though it is a rude way to address
one&rsquo;s female relatives and I apologized to her
afterwards, and now I think I will have to
undo my apology because I feel so glad and
happy every time I think I called her it. I
couldn&rsquo;t help hearing because I was in the
next room, and anyway I didn&rsquo;t mind if I
did hear it. She said to my mother: &lsquo;I suppose
you&rsquo;ve made up your mind already what to do
about Mr. Dennett.&rsquo; &lsquo;About Mr. Dennett?&rsquo;
said my mother, and she sounded frightened,&mdash;she
is much more frightened of my Aunt
Sarah than I am. &lsquo;Even you can&rsquo;t be such a
ninny,&rsquo; said my aunt, &lsquo;as to think he comes
here for nothing. A man of his age doesn&rsquo;t
come from Springfield for the purpose of an
afternoon&rsquo;s conversation.&rsquo; &lsquo;I hadn&rsquo;t faced it
that way,&rsquo; said mamma. &lsquo;Pooh! Pooh!&rsquo; said
my aunt. &lsquo;There&rsquo;s a limit to even your folly;
I hope you have planned to do the sensible
thing and if you have not, you should save
him the humiliation of declaring himself, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>26]</a></span>
he&rsquo;ll do now very soon, no doubt.&rsquo; &lsquo;He pretended
business brought him here,&rsquo; said my
mother. &lsquo;Business, indeed,&rsquo; said Aunt Sarah,
and she made a noise like a snort, which if
I made she would consider very rude. I wish
there was one day a year when children could
tell their aunts how rude they are at times,
just as their aunts tell them every day in the
week. &lsquo;The business of courting is what he is
about, and with an atom of honesty you must
know it, and now I want to know what you are
going to do.&rsquo; &lsquo;It&rsquo;s rather hard; I&rsquo;m going to
call Ellen,&rsquo; said my mother; and I had to move
rather rapidly not to be found too near the
door, which showed me that I was listening,
which one ought never to do. &lsquo;Ellen,&rsquo; said my
mother; and my aunt then said a word which
I am not allowed to say. &lsquo;Squizzelty Betsey,&rsquo;
said she, &lsquo;what has Ellen to do with it?&rsquo; &lsquo;I&rsquo;m
going to consult with Ellen&rsquo;; and then, when
I was in the room, &lsquo;Ellen,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;your
aunt seems to think that Mr. Dennett wishes
to become a new father to you. How do you
like this idea?&rsquo; &lsquo;Would you have to keep
house for him,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;the way you did for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>27]</a></span>
dear papa?&rsquo; &lsquo;More so,&rsquo; said my mamma. &lsquo;I
don&rsquo;t think we should be happy then,&rsquo; said I.
At this Aunt Sarah rocked back and forth and
she groaned as though her stomach hurt her.
While my aunt was groaning, I could see my
mother turn her back and I knew by her actions
that she was putting her handkerchief to
her mouth to keep from laughing, and which
I have often seen her do when my aunt was here.
&lsquo;It made us both very nervous,&rsquo; I explained
to her, &lsquo;getting meals exactly on time and
doing all the things that a man has a right to
have perfect in his own house, which is what
papa used to say, but we have not, since we&rsquo;ve
lived together, had to have anything perfect
at all; we never think of meal-times or any
other sad things.&rsquo; &lsquo;Listen, Ellen,&rsquo; said my
aunt; &lsquo;you are almost more sensible and
grown-up than your mother; your mother is
still a young woman, a long life of loneliness
confronts her,&mdash;more than that, a cramped
financial situation. You&rsquo;ll always have to go
without and without and without. It would
be from every point of view a dignified and
suitable alliance and one which your mother
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>28]</a></span>
should be happy to make and which any
woman of her age and position and an atom of
sense would do.&rsquo; Here my mother flung out
her hand in the air as though she were throwing
away something and were glad to do it.
I wish I could see her do that again. &lsquo;I respect
him and I like him, and his liking for me
touches me and flatters me, but oh! the running
of a big house; but oh! the pent-up city
streets.&rsquo; &lsquo;And I say so, too,&rsquo; I cried. Then
she suddenly drew me to her and stood me at
arm&rsquo;s length from her, and she said to me,
&lsquo;Ellen, promise me when you grow up, and
when your blood shall leap high, and nothing
happens in this little town, and when the
world calls to you, that you won&rsquo;t blame me.&rsquo;
And my aunt said, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, Emily; plenty
will always happen where Ellen is.&rsquo; I hugged
and kissed her and promised hard. Now there
will be no more presents, and no more bon-bons,
for mother is going to shock him so he will not
want to come again, which she thinks is a
good way to save his vanity, but Aunt Sarah
said: &lsquo;Emily, you are incorrigible.&rsquo; But we
are both, my mother and I, very sorry to lose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>29]</a></span>
our good friend. &lsquo;Can&rsquo;t men be friends with
you,&rsquo; I asked, &lsquo;without wanting to marry you?&rsquo;
And my mother said, &lsquo;It seems not, dear.&rsquo;
But when I grow up it is going to be different
with me.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>


<p>Ellen wrote about this time:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;Grandma Hathaway, Aunt Sarah and
mamma, all don&rsquo;t know what to do about me.
I should be much grown-upper than I am.
&lsquo;Mercy,&rsquo; said Aunt Sarah, &lsquo;that great girl of
yours, Emily, acts so that she makes me
tremble for fear she will some day swing by
a tail from a bough, like a monkey.&rsquo; [Here
we see Miss Grant foreshadowing the Darwinian
theory.] They don&rsquo;t know I try to be good,
but I do try; but when joy gets into my feet
I have to run, and I love to feel like that. I
think I only try to be good when I am not
happy. I have said my prayers about it, and
the awful thing is when I say my prayers I
feel as if God said: &lsquo;Never mind, Ellen, run
if you like.&rsquo; They always say to me: &lsquo;Why
can&rsquo;t you sit and sew under the trees with the
other girls?&rsquo; Oh, if they only knew what we
talked about when we sit and sew! And even
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>31]</a></span>
Roberta does, though she disapproves of all
silliness. I have never seen any girl disapprove
of all silliness as does Roberta. But what we
sit and talk about is <i>beaux</i>, though Roberta
doesn&rsquo;t call hers that, and he isn&rsquo;t. And
when Roberta talks so beautifully, I often talk
the same way, but deep in my heart I know I
wish I had a real beau, like the grown-up girls
we talk about. It&rsquo;s strange, though, that
Roberta has none, because she has more of
one than any of the rest of us, because she
writes notes to Leonard Dilloway and he carries
home her books. When I said, &lsquo;He is your
beau,&rsquo; she was very shocked. &lsquo;I wish you
would not speak so to me,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;it pains
me. I shall never love, anyway, but once.
I am far too young to think of such things.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Why do you do it?&rsquo; I asked her. This made
her cross. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t,&rsquo; she answered. &lsquo;Leonard
is my friend.&rsquo; But the rest of us know she is
in love. So when they talk to me about being
a hoyden and ask me to sit and sew, I feel like
a hypocrite, because I know that young girls
like us are much more grown-up than they
were when Aunt Sarah and Grandma Hathaway
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>32]</a></span>
were young, and that they would dislike
one as much as the other. Though I am young
in actions I have such old thoughts that I am
surprised and wish I could help being proud
of myself for them. I have older thoughts than
Janie or Mildred, or even Roberta. Roberta
sounds older, but her thoughts are tied with
strings while mine are not.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>This sketch of hers is an accurate picture
of the conversations between young girls that
are going on forever and ever when three or
four long-legged youngsters are together. Their
talk leads inevitably, as did ours, toward their
business in life. To the lads we were adventures&mdash;not
to be confused with the real business
they had to do in the world; to us they
were life itself.</p>

<p>Like all young girls, we lived in a close little
world of our own. No one entered it, nor could
we come out toward others&rsquo;. We were passionate
spectators at the feast of life, picking up
the crumbs of experience which came our way;
for in our civilization we are treated as children
at an age when Juliet ran away for love, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>33]</a></span>
Beatrice set Dante&rsquo;s heart to beating. And
yet our hearts beat, and we were tragic and
ineffectual Juliets, appearing on our balconies
to youths who saw only the shortness of our
skirts. We knew without knowing that our
little lean arms were to be the cradles of the
unborn generation. Forever and ever we tried
to tell those whom we met, &ldquo;I am Eve,&rdquo; and
couldn&rsquo;t, not knowing the way past the angel
with the flaming sword of self-consciousness.</p>

<p>It was the great adventure of Janie Acres
which made us conscious of our absorption in
boys. There had been a merry-making which
took place in a barn, and in talking it over
afterwards, we recounted the conversation of
each boy who had spoken to us, giving the
impression of having snubbed them one and
all; which, indeed, we often did, but against
our wills, because embarrassment made us
gruff.</p>

<p>Janie had the adventure of hiding in the
same corn-bin with a lad, and what occurred
in the corn-bin she was coy of telling. When
pressed, she flushed and looked the other way.
It was Ellen who brought the utter innocence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>34]</a></span>
and lack of romance to light with her merciless
truthfulness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did he kiss you?&rdquo; asked she.</p>

<p>We were shocked at her frankness. We never
spoke of such things as kisses directly. The
delicacy of our little souls was deeply wounded.</p>

<p>And Janie replied:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, not exactly. But,&rdquo; she faltered, &ldquo;he
would have if I had stayed there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo; asked Ellen coldly.</p>

<p>Thus it was she pricked the bubble of sentiment.
We were all rather horrified, immensely
interested and rather envious. We now perceived
our sentimentality. We ourselves were
shocked a little by some of our temerities, for
in the wide conspiracy of silence around us we
imagined we were the only adventurous ones
in the world. Characteristically, it was I who
suggested that momentous association, the
&ldquo;Zinias,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Old Maid Club.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ellen wrote:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;We made up our minds that we were always
to be true friends of men and lift their
minds up as women should. We are going to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>35]</a></span>
think only of our studies, our homes, and of
religion. Roberta says we may as well begin
now, for we are getting older every minute,
and one of us is already fourteen. And before
we know it we will be thinking of nothing but
boys. We have only to look around us to see
what such things lead to. Patty Newcomb and
Elizabeth Taylor and all those big girls are both
forward and bold. When I said, &lsquo;Roberta, isn&rsquo;t
noticing everything they do and talking about
it just the same as talking about boys?&rsquo; she
said at once, &lsquo;It is not the same at all,&rsquo; in the
tone that I know she doesn&rsquo;t want me to say
anything more. And when I said, &lsquo;Oh, Roberta,
aren&rsquo;t we rather young yet to think
about being old maids?&rsquo; she replied sternly,
&lsquo;It is never too young to begin.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>I feel rather sorry now for the stern, little
Roberta. I feel sorry, too, for Janie Acres and
her kiss that never was. She would have been
so proud of it; it would have been her proof
that she was a young lady.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>


<p>No sooner had Ellen covenanted &ldquo;Thou
shalt not!&rdquo; than off she went on her first adventure,&mdash;a
trifling one but bleeding. She
walked one day to the academy with Arthur
McLain. He wore long trousers. Of this fatal
occurrence Ellen remarks touchingly: &ldquo;I tried
very hard to be interesting, but I chose the
wrong thing.&rdquo; It is a mistake frequently made
by grown men and women. Alas! capricious
fate that governs these things turned my
sweet, unconscious Ellen to one forever on the
alert for the appearance of this long-legged
quidnunc.</p>

<p>I will give three or four paragraphs from her
journal:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;I asked Aunt Sarah if she wanted me to
get her some more yarn when hers ran short.
She answered, &lsquo;Yes, you may, though I wish,
Ellen, my dear child, that you were as eager to
do your work as you are to wait on others.&rsquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>37]</a></span>
But I knew all the time that I offered to go
because I hoped that I should see him, and I
should have told my aunt that that was why
I offered.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>A few days later comes the touching little
expression of the desire of the eyes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;Last week I walked all over town to catch
glimpses of him. I went to the post-office, and
he wasn&rsquo;t there; I went down past the school-house
and past his house, and whenever I saw
a boy coming toward me, it was hard to breathe.
The whole day was empty and I thought it
would never be night.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>Again:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;To-day I saw him; he passed by me and
just said, &lsquo;Hulloa, Ellen.&rsquo; When I stopped for
a moment, I thought he would speak to me.
In school this morning he stopped and talked,
but all my words went away and I seemed so
stupid. At night I make up things I would
like to say to him, and when he stops for a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>38]</a></span>
moment,&mdash;oh, he stops so seldom,&mdash;I forget
them all.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>Throughout all this, not once does she use
the word <em>love</em>. From that terrible and impersonal
longing, unaware of itself and unrecognized,
Ellen walked out toward the long-trousered
boy. She spread before him as much as
she could of her little shy sweetnesses. She
walked up and down the silent streets waiting
for him. Later she writes: &ldquo;I had no single
reason in the world for liking him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was with Ellen at the moment of her disillusion.
We were out walking together when
Arthur McLain came toward us. Ahead of us,
tail wagging, ran the beloved mongrel Faro.
He stopped to sniff at Arthur. Arthur shooed
him away. He was a lad timid about dogs, it
seems. Faro saw his nervousness, and, for
deviltry, barked. Arthur kicked at him with
the savageness of fear.</p>

<p>I can see Ellen now gathering her dog to her
with one regal sweep of the hand and walking
past the boy, her head erect, her cheeks scarlet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I <em>hate</em> a coward,&rdquo; she said to me in a low,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>39]</a></span>
tense voice; and later with a flaming look, &ldquo;I
would have killed him with my <em>hands</em> if he had
hurt Faro,&rdquo; she cried.</p>

<p>So humiliated was she that she says no word
in her journal for her reason for her change of
heart. She could not forgive him for having
made a fool of herself about him&mdash;about one
so unworthy. For of all things in the world
hard to forgive, this is the hardest.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;I would be glad if he were dead. Oh, I
know I am awful, but it is like that. Think of
him walking around this town day by day, and
I will have to meet him; when I go uptown,
when I go to school, I will be avoiding him
exactly the way I used to look for him. Oh,
if he would only go away.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>It is not only Ellen who would like to slay
the dead ghosts of unworthy loves.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;He walks up and down, and doesn&rsquo;t know
I have looked at him. Oh, if he knew that, I
think I should die [her journal goes on]. He
walks up and down and doesn&rsquo;t know that I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>40]</a></span>
so hate the sight of him. I don&rsquo;t hate him, but
just the sight of him&mdash;so awfully I hate it.
Everything he does seems to me so tiresome;
his loud laugh makes me feel sick, and he
doesn&rsquo;t know anything. I make-believe to
myself that he walked all over town after me
and got in my way and annoyed me until I
said, &lsquo;I will be very glad, Arthur, if you would
cease these undesired attentions.&rsquo; How could
he cease anything he had never begun, for it
wasn&rsquo;t at all like that it happened. I should
feel so much happier if I only could have hurt
him, too.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>This experience, so phantasmal and yet so
poignant, led to the Zinias&rsquo; premature death.
Conscience invaded Ellen now that disillusion
had done its blighting work. There came a day
when she could no longer keep to herself her
deviation from the precise morals demanded
by the Zinias.</p>

<p>It was after a walk toward evening up the
mountain, full of pregnant silences, that she
confessed:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You would despise me, if you really knew
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>41]</a></span>
me. I&rsquo;m not the kind of a girl we are trying
to be.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a name="illo2" id="illo2"></a>
<img src="images/thc03.jpg" width="600" height="418"
alt="Ellen and the three Zinias" />
</div>

<p class="caption">I HATE YOUR SOCIETY ANYWAY! I NEVER DID WANT TO BE AN OLD MAID</p>

<p>It shocked me and thrilled me at the same
time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What have you been doing?&rdquo; I asked her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you,&rdquo; she told me. &ldquo;You would
despise me too much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Ellen!&rdquo; I cried. &ldquo;Tell me about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No! No!&rdquo; she said; and she buried her face
in the moss in a very agony of shame. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
tell a human soul.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And she still left me with a feeling of having
had an interesting sentimental experience.
Thus may we, when young, rifle sweetness
from the blossom of despair.</p>

<p>It was communicated to the other two Zinias
that Ellen&rsquo;s conduct had been unbecoming a
sincere old maid, and when they turned on her,
instead of shame, she had for them: &ldquo;I hate
your society, anyway! I never did want to be
an old maid!&rdquo;</p>

<p>As I look back, this adventure closes for us
a certain phase of life as definitely as though
we had shut the door. We all realized, though
we were not honest enough to say it aloud, that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>42]</a></span>
we too didn&rsquo;t wish to be old maids. And all
this happened because an unlovable boy had
made Ellen like him. So much at the mercy of
men are women! Just a shadow of the Cyprian
over us and we blossomed. It was the shadow
of a shadow; it had not one little objective
event to give it substance, yet the Zinias withered.</p>




<p class="padtop"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>43]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>


<p>With a deep revulsion of feeling, Ellen gave
up girls, sewing, and Zinias, and made a dash
into childhood with Alec Yorke. Alec at this
time was a strong lad of thirteen, a head shorter
than Ellen. I remember even then he seemed
more a person than the other boys, though at
the monkey-shining age.</p>

<p>They egged one another on until the ordinary
obstacles that stand in people&rsquo;s way did not
exist. They became together drunken with the
joy of life. In this mood, they disappeared
together one day, to the scandal of Miss
Sarah. She was particularly annoyed because
Mrs. Payne refused to be disturbed by the
event.</p>

<p>&ldquo;While he and Ellen are off together, they
are somewhere having a good time. Why should
I worry?&rdquo; said she. They had come together
to find out if Ellen was at my house.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I had known Ellen was gone with Alec,
Sarah, I should never have gone to look for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>44]</a></span>
her. I wasn&rsquo;t worried about her, anyway; I
only wanted company,&rdquo; said she, with more
asperity than usual.</p>

<p>The two returned at sunset, the glamour of
a glorious day about them. They merely told
vaguely: &ldquo;They had been off on the mountain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It leaked out that they had been as far as
the village, ten miles away, and that the peddler
had given them a lift back. This last was
a scandal.</p>

<p>An Irish peddler lived on the outskirts of
our village, and this was before the day when
foreigners were plenty. He lived contrary to
our American customs,&mdash;the pig roamed at
will, in friendly fashion, through his cabin.
He sang in Gaelic as he drove his cart with its
moth-eaten, calico horse,&mdash;songs that were
now wildly sad, now wildly gay. He was alien,
so we disapproved of him.</p>

<p>I remonstrated with Ellen on this.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I like him,&rdquo; was her only answer.</p>

<p>This had not been all the adventure, nor was
this the end of it. To tell the story in Ellen&rsquo;s
own words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>45]</a></span>
&ldquo;Alec and I were picking currants at Aunt
Sarah&rsquo;s when I heard a voice behind me, and
I never knew before what it meant when I
read in books, that &lsquo;their hearts were in their
mouths.&rsquo; I thought mine would beat its way
right out of me and lie thumping at my feet
when I heard a voice say: &lsquo;Oh, here are my
little friends from Erin&rsquo;s Isle.&rsquo; I suppose it
is because I am very bad that it never occurred
to me until that minute that fooling a minister,
by pretending to be the peddler&rsquo;s children, was
not right, especially when it was Alec&rsquo;s and
my singing songs in what we made him believe
was Gaelic that made him buy so many more
things. I wonder if all people who do wrong
only feel badly when they are found out? I
turned around and I thought I should fall, for
my mother was with him, and Aunt Sarah and
uncle and our own minister. Uncle Ephraim
had not heard what he said, and now, &lsquo;Permit
me, Mr. Sweetser,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;to present my
little niece, Ellen, Mrs. Payne&rsquo;s little daughter,
and our neighbor, Master Alec Yorke.&rsquo; I saw
him wondering if we really could be the same
children, because, while we were playing that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>46]</a></span>
we were the peddler&rsquo;s children, we had taken
off our shoes and stockings to make ourselves
look like wild Irish children, and had succeeded
very well, indeed. I thought for a moment that
perhaps he wouldn&rsquo;t say anything, but Aunt
Sarah&rsquo;s ears were open. &lsquo;What was that? Did
I hear you say &ldquo;your little friends from Erin&rdquo;?
Have you seen these children before?&rsquo; This
was an awful moment. &lsquo;These are the same
children that came with the Irish peddler to
my house.&rsquo; &lsquo;Ha! Ha! I knew that those children
were gone for no good, Emily, and that
they were strangely silent about their exploits,&rsquo;
Aunt Sarah said. &lsquo;Do you mean,&rsquo; said Uncle
Ephraim, &lsquo;that my niece and Horace Yorke&rsquo;s
son made believe to be the children of a drunken,
Irish peddler, and thus appeared before you?&rsquo;
&lsquo;Not only that,&rsquo; said Mr. Sweetser sadly, &lsquo;but
they sang to us in Gaelic.&rsquo; &lsquo;Gaelic,&rsquo; snorted
Aunt Sarah; &lsquo;never a word does she know of
Gaelic. I have heard her making up gibberish
to the tunes that that peddler sings on his way.&rsquo;
Here Alec acted extremely noble, though it
annoyed me very much, and I am sure that
I am a very ungrateful girl that it did annoy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>47]</a></span>
me. He spoke right up and said: &lsquo;Mr. Grant,
it is all my fault. It was I who thought of
being children of the Irish peddler and I who
suggested that we hop on his cart. I should
take all the blame.&rsquo; There was not one word
of truth in this, for we had often ridden with
the peddler before, and the idea of playing that
we were his children was my own, and without
thinking I told them so. &lsquo;Let us say no more
about this childish prank,&rsquo; said Mr. Sweetser.
&lsquo;These children have shown real nobility, the
little lad in desiring to shield Miss Ellen and
Miss Ellen in not permitting herself to be
shielded.&rsquo; Well, I knew that we should have
more of it and plenty later, and we did when
Aunt Sarah came ravening&mdash;there is no other
word to use for it, though I know it is not polite&mdash;down
to our house. It all oppressed me very
much, even though Alec whispered: &lsquo;We can
make-believe we are being persecuted by the
Philistines.&rsquo; I know I have disgraced the
family, but I shall never understand why riding
with the peddler should do this. If our family
is any good, it should take more than this.
Uncle Ephraim and Aunt Sarah have said that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>48]</a></span>
I am really too old to act as I do. When I answer,
&lsquo;But if I act so, doesn&rsquo;t it show that I am
not too old, Aunt Sarah?&rsquo; she says: &lsquo;Mercy,
my child, as tall as any flagpole and with legs
like a beanstalk, you&rsquo;ve got to be acting like
a young lady. We can&rsquo;t have young women
of our family getting a ridiculous name.&rsquo; This
means that I must give up Alec. &lsquo;Why you
want that child around all the time is incomprehensible
to me,&rsquo; said my aunt. &lsquo;You are
a good head higher than he is.&rsquo; People are
always measuring things in length and breadth.
How can one measure one&rsquo;s friends by the
pound? Roberta agrees with them. She thinks
I am giddy, and feels that she must be good
for me. I love Roberta more than any other
earthly being beside mamma, but when
Roberta tries to be good for me, I am so
wicked that I try to be bad for Roberta, and
can very easily be so.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>This episode stopped the free skylarking
with Alec. As you have seen, it was explained
to Ellen that since she was fourteen and nearly
a young lady, she must behave as such. When
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>49]</a></span>
I think how many lovely spontaneities have
been offered on the sad and drab altar of
young ladyhood, I could weep, as Ellen did.
Alec&rsquo;s suggestion that they were being persecuted
by the Philistines did not comfort her,
and little Mrs. Payne said sadly:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your aunt and uncle are right, Ellen, and
I suppose I&rsquo;ll have to punish you to satisfy
them, but I can&rsquo;t help knowing that you must
have had a perfectly wonderful day, and they
are few in this world. Don&rsquo;t let your punishment
cloud your memory.&rdquo;</p>




<p class="padtop"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>50]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>


<p>Look back and see if you can remember
when it was you drifted from that part of the
river of life that is little girlhood to that time
when you recognized that you were grown up,
and the eyes of men rested on you speculatively,
interestedly, and your parents foreshadowed
these things by an irritating watchfulness
that you did not understand. The
picture of Ellen that comes to me oftenest is
one of her progress through the streets, her
hair in an anguished neatness, from her desire
to escape Miss Sarah&rsquo;s critical censure, her
skirts longer now, and behind her perpetually
screeled the three motherless babes of our not
long widowed minister. He was a middle-aged
man, ineffectual except for some occasional
Gottbetrunkener moments. From my present
vantage-point I now recognize him to be one
of the brothers of St. Francis by temperament.
He had a true poetic sense, and Ellen would
go to his house for the purpose of washing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>51]</a></span>
dishes and helping about, performing her labors
with the precision which she had only for the
work of other people, her own room, to my
anguish, being a whited sepulcher of disorder,
outwardly fair to the glance of her Aunt Sarah,
while dust lay thick in every unobservable
spot. It was I who kept her bureau drawers
in order.</p>

<p>She writes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;I just can&rsquo;t waste a minute indoors. I
don&rsquo;t know why grown people have so many
things to do. When I get married I am going
to live in a tent and have just one cupboard
where I keep everything, with doors that can&rsquo;t
be seen through. Roberta wrings her hands,
but she would wring them more if she knew
that I have from earliest childhood learned to
sleep quietly in my bed as it takes less time
to make it when I get up. And mother doesn&rsquo;t
care one bit more than I. I am so glad. She
so frequently says: &lsquo;Ellen, this is too sweet
a day to cook&rsquo;; and we eat bread and milk all
day, and don&rsquo;t even light the stove, though
there have been moments when I have been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>52]</a></span>
glad that there is a big kitchen in which they
are always cooking, up at my Aunt Sarah&rsquo;s.
We would get things done much better if it
were not for reading aloud, but so frequently
mother finds things she wants to read, and
then we go on, but not on and on like Mr.
Sylvester and I. We began reading poetry the
other day&mdash;how shall I tell it? And he read
and I read, and he read and I read, until we
understood everything we were reading, the
very heart. We felt as if we had made the
poetry&mdash;just knowing it for ourselves, and
it was us. By pretending I am Mr. Sylvester&rsquo;s
second wife sent by the Lord to take care of
his motherless children, I find I can do housework
very well, for me, though I feel rather
guilty when I look at him, for I know that
even he might be exasperated at the thought of
me as his second wife. But one has to do something.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>Some weeks later this occurs:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;Now I have learned to work so beautifully
and have done so well, besides taking care of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>53]</a></span>
the children and then baking, I feel it isn&rsquo;t
fair not to do it at home. Oh, how hard it is
to do work for one&rsquo;s self. I know I should
think I am doing it for my mother, and when
I was very little I used to pretend that I was
a poor child who supported her mother; but
the little silly pretenses of childhood are now
impossible for me since I am so much over
fifteen.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>It was at this time that we began to be allowed
to go to the young people&rsquo;s parties,
because with us there was no fixed and rigid
time when girls come out. They went when
their legs were long enough and when they had
learned to fold their hands properly in their
laps and sit with decorum, which with Ellen
and myself occurred somewhere toward sixteen.
Ellen writes of one of these parties:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;I am sitting waiting to go. I have a new
pale-blue dress with little ruffles&mdash;little, tiny
ruffles. Aunt Sarah is disgusted that mother
put so much work into my dress because it
isn&rsquo;t practical, when we need so many things,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>54]</a></span>
for her to waste her eyes. And it is true, but oh,
how much more fun it is to work on ornaments
than useful things, and parties are like ornaments.
I think they are like jewels, and a
great, big, enormous party, with lights and
flowers, like one reads about in books, must
be like having strings of pearls. All I hope
is that I will act politely, and not show how
pleased I am, because if I did I should shout
and sing. My Aunt Sarah said: &lsquo;Ellen, please,
my child, don&rsquo;t make me feel as if you were
going to burst into flame or perhaps slide
down the banisters.&rsquo; And, indeed, I often look
in the glass and wonder that I can look so
quiet and unshining.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>It was in this high mood that Ellen met
Edward Graham. I know now that he must
have been an honest lad, square-cornered,
solid, with an awkward, bearish, honest walk,
nice, kind eyes, and a short mop of wiry, glinting
curls as his only beauty, which fitted his
head like a close-clinging cap, stopping
abruptly instead of straggling down unkemptwise,
as hair is apt to do, on the back of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>55]</a></span>
neck and temples. It was Ellen who noticed
this and wrote about it. He must have been
not over one-and-twenty, but he was instructor
at the academy in chemistry and
mathematics.</p>

<p>Well do I remember hearing this conversation
at the other side of a vine-trellis at this
party. In her low, pensive voice Ellen was
saying: &ldquo;I lived by the sea; it was in my veins.
The noise of its beating is in my heart. One
cannot live inland when one has been a lighthouse-keeper&rsquo;s
daughter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rage and anger surged in me, for Ellen had
made but three visits to the sea in all her
days, and one of which occurred when she was
too small to remember it. As you may gather
from this, her father had not been a lighthouse-keeper.
I stamped my foot; a little-girl <em>mad</em>
feeling came over me. I took my saucer of
goodies and my cake firmly in my hand and
went to confront her then and there. She had
talked so beautifully about truth and life that
very afternoon.</p>

<p>I couldn&rsquo;t do it. The little sarcastic remark
that anger had invented for me died still-born.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>56]</a></span>
She was too lovely; something almost mystically
beautiful radiated from her whole little
personality. &ldquo;I am so happy,&rdquo; she seemed
to say. &ldquo;Let me stay happy one moment
more.&rdquo; There was always about her this heart-rending
quality. It was not until I could draw
her by herself that I spoke to her, and then my
remonstrance was gentle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must tell him the truth,&rdquo; I insisted
kindly.</p>

<p>And Ellen wrung her hands and said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Roberta! you make my heart feel like
a shriveled-up little leaf; you make me feel
like a bad dream, like when you find yourself
in company without your clothes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But I repeated inexorably:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You <em>must</em> tell him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I can see her now drooping up to him and
the appealing glance of her large eyes. Presently
I saw him take both her hands in his, and
then she came toward me, her feet dancing,
a glad, naughty look in her eyes. She answered
my glance of inquiry with:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He asked me why I told him what I did,
and, since I was telling the whole truth, I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>57]</a></span>
answered, &lsquo;I wanted awfully to have you like
me.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>That, you see, is what I got for interfering
with my friend and torturing her.</p>




<p class="padtop"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>58]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>


<p>The next few weeks there were very few
entries.</p>

<p>Ellen was very bad at mathematics, and her
uncle, who rarely left his seclusion to interest
himself in her affairs and who merely enjoyed
her personality, thought it would be a fine
plan if this responsible young man should give
his Ellen lessons. Mr. Grant was advanced
in his theories concerning the female brain,
which, he said, lost its vagueness and inexactnesses
through a mathematical training. Ellen
merely makes a note of this.</p>

<p>There are very few entries in her journal at
this time, for she was playing with the great
forces of life. God help us all! We didn&rsquo;t
know passion when it came to us, nor how
should we? It was the warp on which were
woven all our generous impulses, all our high
idealisms, making in all the shimmering garments
in which we clothed our fragile, newborn
spirits.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>59]</a></span>
Ellen walked in a magic circle of her own
ignorance, never dreaming of love or of being
in love. So absorbed was she that it seemed
like some one walking down a road that leads
directly into a swift-flowing river, and not
knowing that the river was there until one had
walked directly into it. So close is the so-called
silly moment of girlhood to the moment of full
development, that when the change comes it
sometimes takes only overnight. It was only
a few pages, after all, that separated Ellen,
who managed to do the minister&rsquo;s dishes by
pretending that she was his second wife, from
the Ellen who wrote:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how to begin what I am going
to say. I thought everybody in the world
must know what had happened to me. I
thought my face must shine with it. I thought
I must look like some one very different from
myself,&mdash;like a woman, perhaps. I came
home through Lincoln Field and squeezed myself
through a hole in the fence so no one could
see me. I came up the back way to my room
and locked the door. My heart beat both ways
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>60]</a></span>
at once when I looked in the glass, but I
looked just the same as before I went out&mdash;as
before he kissed me. I went downstairs
and my hand seemed too heavy to open the
door and go in where I heard their voices. I
was afraid to go because I felt: &lsquo;They will
know, they will know!&rsquo; Mr. Sylvester and
mamma and Aunt Sarah were there. &lsquo;Where
have you been?&rsquo; said mamma. And I could
not answer. I felt I had been gone so long and
so far. I could hear the blood beating in my
ears, and when my aunt said: &lsquo;I wish, Ellen,
you would stand up straighter,&rsquo; I could hardly
lift my head.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Next day there is an entry: &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know
we were engaged until he told me, &lsquo;Why, of
course, we are.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>Thus simply does youth plight its troth.
They had been together and he had kissed
her, and so, of course, they were engaged. Of
course, they were ready to fight the long battle
of life side by side, and she who had given so
much in her kiss had walked out past the doors
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>61]</a></span>
of girlhood; through that one light touch she
felt that her whole life must be then surrendered
to the boy who had had the magic word
for her. They decided to tell no one on
account of their youth.</p>

<p>No sooner did this honest lad have my rainbow
Ellen in his hands than he started in trying
to make some one else of her. I read her
journal that follows with a certain heartache
because I was not blameless in this matter.
I, too, wanted to take this gay and shimmering
child and turn her into something else; trim
her generosities and check her impulses.</p>

<p>Another thing that makes me rage is the
fact that my knowledge of the lives of men
teaches me that, had Ellen had one little
affectation in which to clothe herself, her
young lover would have been on his knees
before her instead of being the pedantic young
master. Ellen&rsquo;s journal at this time varies
from a thing glittering with life, from being
drunk with the heady wine of being beloved
for the first time, to a book of copy-book
maxims, beginning with: &ldquo;Edward says I must
read&mdash;or do&mdash;or act&mdash;or mustn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>62]</a></span>
Poor young man! He wrote her decalogues
by the dozen, and yet the tragedy of him is
that he tasted her special quality and loved
her while trying to kill it. The youth of Ellen
and her high joy of living carried him along in
spite of himself, though he always made Ellen
pay for his happiness by lectures on the seriousness
of life.</p>

<p>It was here that Alec began to perceive the
place he had in her life. They had a game they
played that they called &ldquo;Two Years Ago,&rdquo;
in which they outdid their own childish pranks.
Ellen remarks ingenuously:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;I suppose that I ought to tell Edward how
Alec and I rest ourselves from growing up, but
there is no place in him to tell this to. I tried it
with Roberta, and she just understood what it
was about, but doesn&rsquo;t see why I want to do
it; and I don&rsquo;t know myself exactly, except that
I just have to.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>Then from one day to another Alec was
sent West to an uncle and two weeks later, as
had been planned, Edward left. He was to go
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>63]</a></span>
away for a year and a half, and then come back
and formally ask for Ellen&rsquo;s hand. It shocked
Ellen terribly that she missed Alec most.</p>

<p>Through all the year and a half that followed,
Ellen never told me anything of what
was in her mind, nor did she tell her mother,
and here is the characteristic of their young
girlhood that people seem to forget&mdash;this
nameless reticence. So, alone, she went through
the crucial thing that falling out of love always
is. Another girl in her situation might have
deceived herself, the idea of a grown-up lover
was such a pleasant one to a girl of Ellen&rsquo;s
age. Ellen was unaware of the disillusion
she was preparing for herself. She writes,
appalled:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what has happened to me,
I can only describe it by saying I have waked
up. I know now that I am not in love with
Edward and I just understood this from one
day to another. He has not done anything at
all. He writes me just the way he always has.
He hasn&rsquo;t changed, so I suppose I am fickle
and bad, and that I can&rsquo;t trust myself, for if
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>64]</a></span>
this wasn&rsquo;t real, I don&rsquo;t know what can be
real, and yet I feel as though I had never loved
him at all. I sometimes wonder if I should
have become engaged to some other person if
it had happened that some other person had
kissed me.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>Write him of her change of heart she could
not, for as time went on apparently the memory
of her became dearer to the boy. Good and
slow and pedantic, he yet realized what a
lovely thing life had put into his hands, and
he longed to keep it, and he communicated this
ever-growing longing to Ellen. She so wanted
to keep faith with herself and to live up to
all the things about &ldquo;one love and only one
love&rdquo; that books from all time have taught
young girls they ought to feel. She felt a great
need of talking about it with some one and
could not bring herself to do it.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;If I could only tell some one and ask what
to do, but it seems disloyal. Roberta wouldn&rsquo;t
understand and some way I don&rsquo;t want to
worry my little mother. Sometimes I feel as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>65]</a></span>
if I did tell her without saying any words,
when I sit beside her and hold her hand and
feel afraid. The other night we sat alone in
the dark. The smell of honeysuckle vines was
so sweet that I shall never smell it again without
thinking how soft her hand felt in the
dark. She said: &lsquo;When I was your age, I used
often to want to tell my mother things and
didn&rsquo;t dare. My mother was more like your
Aunt Sarah.&rsquo; My heart beat so when she said
this that it seemed as if she could hear it, but
I only pressed her hand and kissed it. Then
she said to me: &lsquo;You have seemed a little
absent-minded lately, my darling child; have
you anything on your mind, Ellen?&rsquo; And
I said in a low voice, and blushing,&mdash;and I
took my face off her hand for fear she would
feel me blush against it,&mdash;&lsquo;What should I
have?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>As I read her cramped little handwriting
a sudden wave of shame creeps over me as
though I had gone back; I remember her so
well; I was so on the outside; I loved her so
truly. Meantime, as every day shortened the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>66]</a></span>
distance that separated them, a certain dread
encompassed Ellen; she visualized their approach
one to another in this way:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;It was as if I was standing still and he was
standing still, and that the space between us
was being shortened by little jerks, and each
jerk was as a day that makes us come nearer
and nearer. I don&rsquo;t want to see him&mdash;oh,
I don&rsquo;t want to see him. I don&rsquo;t know what
I&rsquo;m going to say to him&mdash;perhaps nothing.
He will look at me kindly&mdash;oh, kindly and
critically,&mdash;and then I shall be afraid; afraid
of hurting him&mdash;afraid of him.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>A little later she writes again:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;If I go on feeling undecided as to what I
shall do, something will snap inside my head.
I can&rsquo;t feel so uncertain. He wrote to me lately,
&lsquo;Ellen, my life would be utterly worthless without
you.&rsquo; I cannot ruin any one&rsquo;s life, and my
life is pretty worthless, anyway, so I am going
to stand by my first promise, which is the
only brave thing to do. Now that I have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>67]</a></span>
decided that, I feel at peace. I loved him once
and my love will come back.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>She adds touchingly, &ldquo;I have two weeks
before he comes&rdquo;; but these two weeks of
respite were denied her. I was going down to
Ellen&rsquo;s when I met Edward Graham on his
way there also.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come to surprise Ellen,&rdquo; he said. So
it happened that it was I who went to her with
the words, &ldquo;Edward Graham&rsquo;s waiting for you
downstairs,&rdquo; and wondered at the sudden ebb
of color from her face.</p>



<p class="padtop"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>68]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>


<p>It was with her mind utterly made up as to
what course to take that she went to her ordeal.
She was going to offer herself a little, white
offering before the altar of the fetish which decrees
that we shall keep our promises. Herding
her to this doom were all the cruel things
which we teach our young girls. In New England
in my day we did not joke about engagements.
In her innocence, having given
her lover her mouth to be kissed and her hand
to be held, and having promised to be his, she
had definitely decided that in the sight of God
she was his, and so she dressed herself in her
best that she might please him.</p>

<p>I suppose that had I made up my mind to
do what Ellen did at that age, I should have
gone through to the iniquitous end, shut my
eyes and quieted my rebellious spirit with
sophistries. I should have done according to
whichever part of the strange anomalous teaching
which we give young girls that I believed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>69]</a></span>
in most. Had I believed most that it is the
crime of crimes to marry without love, I should
have frankly made up my mind to break the
engagement, but had I believed that one may
love but once, and that an engagement is a
marriage of the spirit, and that in giving this
I had given so much to one man that I had
nothing left for any other,&mdash;it is strange, but
this is still taught to girls to-day,&mdash;I should
have traveled that terrible road. For girls as
young as Ellen have to find their way around
through a world that is hung with a cobweb of
lies, which is put there to screen us from the
real world. The suffering that the unlearning
of these lies has given to girls of our class from
all time is greater than the suffering through
which we must pass to come to a wider religious
belief.</p>

<p>Ellen might make up her mind as to what
to do, but she lived by instincts. She writes
about it:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t. All day I pretended to myself
that I was glad he was coming, and that as
soon as I saw him everything would be all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>70]</a></span>
right, but it is a terrible, awful thing. He cares.
He put his arms out toward me and said:
&lsquo;Ellen, oh, Ellen!&rsquo; All I could say&mdash;I was
so cruel, so stupid&mdash;was, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t&rsquo;; and
I meant I didn&rsquo;t want him to touch me. And
then he said, and it was worse because he has
grown much older looking, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t understand.
What&rsquo;s the matter, Ellen?&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;I
can&rsquo;t marry you; I don&rsquo;t love you.&rsquo; He said:
&lsquo;Why, what have I done?&rsquo; What could I tell
him? It was just that he was he and I was I,
and that&rsquo;s no reason, and yet it is the only
reason in the world that you can&rsquo;t change,
and that&rsquo;s why you love people and that&rsquo;s
why you don&rsquo;t love them. We both stood and
just stared at each other. While I looked at
him all the color went out of his face and it
grew gray. &lsquo;When did it happen, Ellen?&rsquo; he
said. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rsquo; I told him; &lsquo;it just went
out.&rsquo; &lsquo;You might have told me.&rsquo; &lsquo;I meant
never to tell you,&rsquo; I said; and then his color
all came back to his face and this was worse
than before. &lsquo;You meant to marry me just
the same? Then you <em>do</em> care for me; it&rsquo;s just
an idea you&rsquo;ve gotten; it&rsquo;s just because we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>71]</a></span>
have been apart so long. Let&rsquo;s just go on just
as you meant to, Ellen, if there is no one else.&rsquo;
He opened his arms as if he wanted to hide me
from myself in them, but I don&rsquo;t know what
happened to me. I just said, &lsquo;No-no-no-no,&rsquo;
and ran out of the room, and out of the house
up into the orchard. I didn&rsquo;t notice, but
threw myself down under the tree and cried
and cried. I don&rsquo;t know how long I was there,
but I heard my mother saying: &lsquo;Ellen, Ellen,&rsquo;
and the sound of her footsteps coming toward
me, but I couldn&rsquo;t stop sobbing so that she
wouldn&rsquo;t find me like that. She heard me and
came to me and said, &lsquo;Why, Ellen darling!
Child, it is as wet as a river here.&rsquo; She felt
my dress and at first it seemed to me that it
must be wet with my tears, but it was just
the grass. &lsquo;What is it, Ellen?&rsquo; she said to me,
and I told her that we had been engaged and
that I had just seen Edward, and told him that
I didn&rsquo;t want to marry him; and she just
folded me in her arms and said, &lsquo;Why, darling,
you needn&rsquo;t&rsquo;; and she comforted me, and I
felt all safe from everything and just like a
very little girl. Not many people can feel like
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>72]</a></span>
that with their mothers, but I don&rsquo;t think
unless you can that your mother&rsquo;s a mother
to you really. I couldn&rsquo;t go on feeling safe
and rested forever. I&rsquo;ve broken faith with
myself. I can&rsquo;t count on myself any more.
It&rsquo;s a terrible thing not to be able to count on
people you love, but it&rsquo;s worse not to be able
to count on yourself. I couldn&rsquo;t do what I
thought was right; how do I know I will be
able to keep from doing what&rsquo;s wrong? I
think I will try and give up being good, because
most of the things people think are good
I don&rsquo;t understand why. I might have saved
myself all that suffering and been happy and
low-minded, comfortable and contented, and
I think I will be from now on.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>I well remember this epoch in Ellen&rsquo;s life;
she must have been between eighteen and
nineteen when she gave up hope of herself
and went out to be comfortable, low-minded,
and happy, for she told me about this spiritual
change in her. It was a crisis with Ellen,
a spiritual crisis as important as the time in
a boy&rsquo;s life when he makes a breach in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>73]</a></span>
&ldquo;Thou Shalt Nots&rdquo; that have guarded him
around, and surrenders himself to the heady
wine of living and says to himself: &ldquo;I am a
sinner; now let&rsquo;s see what there is in sin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Just about the time Ellen broke her engagement,
a boy named Landry lay heavily
on my conscience. At this time, also, Ellen
was engaged and yet was unhappy, and yet
all I knew about Ellen was that there was
something weighing heavily on her mind, and
all she knew about me was my outward principles
in this matter and none of my inward
storm and stress. I can remember very well
the never-ending conversations we had at this
time. I suppose all young girls who are not
on terms of familiarity with their own souls
thus cloak their real feelings from each other.
For there is happily nothing more usual than
that shivering, shrinking, spiritual modesty
which can tell of no event in life that implicates
another human being. Later the weaker
women outgrow it shamefully, or the finer ones
among us replace it with a beautiful frankness.
There are some happy girls who have been
so simply brought up that they have never
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>74]</a></span>
felt the need for the ambiguities of life as Ellen
and myself did. The facts of the case were
these: Released from the torturing thought
of Edward Graham, the breath of life blew
through Ellen in a storm, while I was being
discreetly courted by George Landry. I had
never had a tumultuous suitor, on account of
my being matter-of-fact in my attitude toward
the boys I knew or instinctively withdrawing
myself from any sentimental approach.
But now this sentimentally inclined youth had
called on me and shown a recurring disposition
to try and hold my hand when we were
alone together. We read a great deal of poetry
also and with deep emphasis. Thus does Satan
trick the unwary. I, Roberta, the straightforward;
I, the hater of philandering, and who
sincerely felt that a self-respecting woman
should be proposed to only by a man she
would willingly accept as her husband, read
verses far-gazing at distant horizons and with
gentle underscorings whose audacity set my
heart to beating. That I had gone into this
slow-moving and decorous little flight of sentiment
seemed so contrary to my ideals that I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>75]</a></span>
felt I must give up my friend and his poetry-reading
and forego the heart-throbbing performance
of having my hand gently captured
and as gently withdrawing it again, both of us
apparently blankly unaware of the actions of
our respective hands. Ellen and I would discuss
our affairs in ambiguities like this:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a doom threatening me,&rdquo; Ellen
would confess.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A doom?&rdquo; asked I, impressed by the sinister
darkness of the word.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fate has tangled up my life,&rdquo; Ellen averred.
&ldquo;I have been deceived in myself, and now that
I know what I am, I don&rsquo;t care.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What sort of fate?&rdquo; I then made bold to ask.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One that will influence my whole life because
it has made me glad I&rsquo;m not good like
I tried to be. I love the feeling of having gotten
rid of goodness, Roberta&rdquo;; and Ellen flashed
me the smile of a naughty angel, and turned
from me to wipe the nose of the youngest Sylvester
baby, Prudentia, who accompanied us
on our woodsy rambles. &ldquo;Can you always decide
everything in your life?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed I cannot,&rdquo; I answered quickly. &ldquo;I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>76]</a></span>
must give up a thing that&rsquo;s sweetest and dearest
in life to me, and I can&rsquo;t decide to do it&mdash;I
am not strong.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Roberta!&rdquo; Ellen cried out. &ldquo;You are
so much stronger than I, for I decided and did
the opposite thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did you want to do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The thing I did do,&rdquo; poor Ellen cried, tears
welling up to her sweet eyes. &ldquo;I wanted to do
what I wanted to do, and yet before I so wanted
to do what was right.&rdquo; Then, with her little
fists pounding on the moss on which we were
sitting, she said: &ldquo;And mighty often, Roberta
Hathaway, what people want to do seems to
me the really right thing to do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As I grow older, it seems to me so very often
that what people want is really the right thing.
There are so many needless sacrifices made in
life,&mdash;sacrifices that do good to no one and
cripple and maim one.</p>


<p class="break">I might have saved myself the worry of giving
up the &ldquo;sweetest and dearest thing in life,&rdquo;
for I had an experience which showed me what
a solemn young fool I was.</p>

If Ellen and I had this intense spiritual
modesty, Janie Acres was not so afflicted. She
was always prolific in detail of any sentimental
adventure which she had, and was generally
only quiet when she had nothing to tell. Ellen
summed this characteristic up in her observation
on Janie&rsquo;s character:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;When Roberta and I don&rsquo;t say anything it
is because we have too much to say, but when
Janie acts as if she knew how God made the
world, it is a sure sign she has nothing to tell.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>Poor Janie Acres! Through all this long
stretch of years I can see her perpetually heart-hungry,
wishing for experiences her very eagerness
denied her; longing for sympathy, companionship,
and love, and when such things
came her way, killing them. She had a curious
jealousy which was kept from its full bloom by
her confidence in herself. When Janie hadn&rsquo;t
sufficient sentimental experiences she would invent
them. And it was because of her inventions
that my little experience which I was taking
so seriously was turned to ashes before me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>78]</a></span>
This trait of Janie&rsquo;s was an incredible one to
me. I, who so diligently hid all trace of any
sentiment in my life, could never comprehend
a temperament that would not only share all
its secrets with its friends, but who also invented
them; and it was only when Janie had
repeatedly emphasized George Landry&rsquo;s attentions
to her at moments when I had been
reading poetry with him that I realized this.
I listened with the gravest feeling of superiority
to Janie&rsquo;s artless prattle. If George Landry
walked up the street with her, it was an event.
I think if she had refused to have him accompany
her to a Sunday-School picnic she would
have recounted it to us as the refusal of a
proposal of marriage.</p>

<p>In some obscure way Janie&rsquo;s interest in
George Landry quickened my own feeling and
gave me emotions of vast superiority which
were very bad for me. All this is brought
vividly back to me by this page of Ellen&rsquo;s journal
which recounts the final d&eacute;nouement:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;We have been having an awful time this
afternoon, and I don&rsquo;t think that any of us
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>79]</a></span>
will feel the same ever again. Roberta has been
crying in my arms and says she feels soiled, but
she has acted so nobly that it will be a comfort
to her, because being noble is always a comfort
to Roberta&mdash;and to almost anybody else.
George Landry has been a friend of Roberta&rsquo;s
for some time, and when the other girls have
joked her about it she has been very stern, and
I&rsquo;ve believed everything Roberta has said because
I think it is horrid to do anything else.
But Janie has been talking about George, too,
in the way she goes on about anybody that
notices her, only who could tell that Janie
would talk about those who don&rsquo;t notice her
in the least? This afternoon we were all talking
together, and she began: &lsquo;Last night George
Landry came past my house and I pretended
not to notice him, and he stopped and said,
&ldquo;Can I come in?&rdquo; And I said, &ldquo;No, it was too
late.&rdquo;&rsquo; &lsquo;What time was it?&rsquo; asked Mildred Dilloway.
&lsquo;Oh, it was about eight o&rsquo;clock, and he
stayed and talked and talked and leaned clear
over the gate, and I kept backing away, and if
mother hadn&rsquo;t called me from the house,&mdash;&rsquo;
Here Mildred broke in and said: &lsquo;Janie Acres!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>80]</a></span>
I don&rsquo;t see how you can tell things like that!
George Landry was at my house all yesterday
evening.&rsquo; &lsquo;Well, it was the evening before
that,&rsquo; said Janie. &lsquo;Well, it wasn&rsquo;t the evening
before that,&rsquo; said Mildred, &lsquo;because he
was at my house all the evening before, too.&rsquo;
&lsquo;I thought your mother was so particular,&rsquo;
began Janie; but Mildred wouldn&rsquo;t let her
change the subject the way Janie knows how
to do, and she said: &lsquo;The way you have gone
on about George Landry has almost made
trouble between George and myself. It has
made me feel quite suspicious at times. But
now I have caught you at it.&rsquo; Janie blushed
very hard and said: &lsquo;You are very spiteful,
Mildred, about it. George Landry does like
me and I haven&rsquo;t told you anything that
wasn&rsquo;t so. Perhaps it wasn&rsquo;t so late when he
leaned over my gate.&rsquo; &lsquo;He wasn&rsquo;t anywhere
near your old gate,&rsquo; said Mildred, &lsquo;and I might
just as well tell you&mdash;&rsquo; And here Mildred,
who is very soft when she loses her temper, and
begins to cry, did all these and made us all very
much embarrassed. &lsquo;And I might as well tell
you&mdash;and you can see how much you have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>81]</a></span>
hurt me&mdash;he kissed me good-night. So you
can see whether it&rsquo;s nice of you to pretend that
George Landry is interested in you or not.&rsquo;
We were all perfectly quiet for a minute, and
then it was that Roberta made her great sacrifice.
Mildred was still crying from excitement
and Janie was at a loss for something to say
for once, and looking very frowning-browed
and jealous. &lsquo;Girls,&rsquo; Roberta said, &lsquo;I have
something to tell you. And you, Mildred,&mdash;whether
George has been attentive to Janie I
don&rsquo;t know, but&mdash;&rsquo; &lsquo;He walked home with me
yesterday afternoon,&rsquo; said Janie. &lsquo;He did not,&rsquo;
replied Roberta firmly; &lsquo;he did not. He was
at my house all yesterday afternoon, and we
were reading poetry and he held my hand.&rsquo;
If Roberta had been the least like Mildred, she
would have cried, too, but she stood there
straight and held her head up as beautiful as
an avenging fate. What she said stopped
Mildred&rsquo;s tears, and she sprang to her feet and
stamped her foot, and said: &lsquo;Well, if he did
that and then came to my house and did what
he did in the evening, he&rsquo;s a pig!&rsquo; And she
stamped her foot again. &lsquo;I said the truth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>82]</a></span>
anyway&rsquo;; and she glared at Janie who now said,
&lsquo;I was just trying to tease both of you.&rsquo; But
Mildred snapped, &lsquo;You were trying to lie to
both of us.&rsquo; And Janie stuck her head on one
side in the most provoking way and said, &lsquo;I
don&rsquo;t want your horrid beau anyway.&rsquo; It was
all very painful, especially to Roberta. She
said: &lsquo;We must never any of us speak to him
again. He is unworthy of our notice. Except
to spare you more pain, Mildred, I would not
have told you about this at all, and I am very
much ashamed of myself, and it serves me
right. I shall never let any one hold my hand
again as long as I live.&rsquo; None of us knew that
any boy could be so double-faced, and we all
have agreed, and Janie Acres, too, that we
shall act as though he did not exist at all, which
will save our dignity and we hope will teach
him something.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>When other people write our lives, they tell
the dates of our births, marriages, and deaths;
they note the year we went to college and when
we left, and all the other irrelevant things; no
one says that it was at such and such a moment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>83]</a></span>
that his soul was born, or that the baptism of
fire that turned away the selfishness of this
woman came at such a time. We keep these
great and obscure birthdays and many minor
ones to ourselves, and this droll little episode
was the definite ending for us of little-girlhood.
In our town we dawdled along in what the
Germans call the &ldquo;back fish&rdquo; age until some
such thing has happened, for we had no custom
of girls coming out all of a sudden full-blown
young ladies; we had to win our spurs in a way.</p>

<p>We thought of ourselves as grown up, to be
sure. Mildred Dilloway had had a very melodramatic
love-affair with one of the lads in the
seminary who had gotten into some sort of a
scrape and was expelled from school. He had
urged Mildred to fly with him. Alas! that
women should be so practical. Even young as
she was, she asked, &ldquo;Where?&rdquo; and when he had
no special place to propose beyond his parents&rsquo;
house, to which he was then repairing, she had
laughed at him, but in spite of all our experiments
in sentiment we had remained immature
in spirit. Now, suddenly, through the actions
of this soft youth, George Landry, we found
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>84]</a></span>
ourselves in an absurd position. The grown
woman in us came to life; we wanted to vindicate
ourselves in our own eyes; and it was
during the next few months that we found
ourselves suddenly grown up and the world&rsquo;s
attitude toward us suddenly changed. From
being the little girls who accepted the casual
kindnesses of older men in a panic of gratitude,
suddenly our position was of those who are
sought out.</p>



<p class="padtop"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>85]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>


<p>Ellen&rsquo;s formal renouncing of goodness
helped us find our place in the grown-up world.
Her gayety had always made her overstep the
bounds of perfect decorum demanded of young
women in my generation, and she set about
carrying out her resolution which she told me
about. I remember well the shocked sort of
quiver with which I recognized myself, even
staid Roberta, in her question:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Roberta, when you&rsquo;re in company, don&rsquo;t
you ever want to do foolish things? When you
see a lot of solemn people saying good-bye
downstairs, don&rsquo;t you want to slide down the
banister into their midst? When Edward
Graham used to lecture me, again and again
I&rsquo;ve wanted to take his hand and skip down
the street singing, &lsquo;Hippity Hop to the Barber
Shop,&rsquo; and see what he&rsquo;d do. I&rsquo;ve always
wanted to do all the foolish things I&rsquo;ve thought
of when I was in company, and now, Roberta,
I&rsquo;m going to!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>86]</a></span>
I had had these erring impulses. Who has
not? In each of us there is a hinterland where
thoughts as fantastic as anything that happens
in dreams gambol around with the irresponsibility
of monkeys. Ellen translated a certain
amount of these into action&mdash;and see what
happened.</p>

<p>This is what makes virtue so discouraging in
an imperfect world. It was her naughtiness
which advertised to the world of men, &ldquo;I am
a sweet and adorable person; I can make you
laugh, and I can make you dream, and I have no
fear.&rdquo; Ellen now acted before strangers with
the inspired foolishness which most of us keep
for those best known to us. Even for them this
mad spirit is not at our beck and call, but must
wait for the time and place to bring it out.
Youth, empty of such lovely, high-spirited, and
drunken moments, must be very sad.</p>

<p>The divine folly of such mirth is only for the
partaker; one must feel the wine of life coursing
through one to understand its spiritual significance.
Joy-drunken young people seem to outsiders
silly, if they don&rsquo;t seem wanton; and
while the things that we did would seem mild
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>87]</a></span>
enough if I told them, they set our little New
England town by the ears during the year that
followed.</p>

<p>Our little coterie gradually acquired the reputation
of giddiness among the older people,
while we steadily became leaders among those
of our own age, and Ellen the central flame
around which we revolved. I myself thought
her too audacious, and even when carried away
by her I used to remonstrate seriously with
her. This accomplished nothing, but it eased
my own conscience.</p>

<p>Edward Graham, who had come back to
teach in the academy, also lectured Ellen continually.
He was one of those tenacious men
who desire a thing all the more when they have
lost it, and I think the full flowering of his affection
for Ellen only came after he knew he
couldn&rsquo;t have her. I think it might never have
come otherwise. His love for her was deep and
fundamental, and the sort of love men treat
like the air they breathe; but had she married
him and been the docile wife she would have
been, he might never even have known himself
to what extent he cared, and still less have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>88]</a></span>
shown it to her. They continued to see much
of each other, because he had put to her the
plausible story that they could still be friends,
and she, of course, eagerly assented, wishing
to make what little reparation she could, and
not realizing that at the back of his mind was
a determination to win her at whatever cost.</p>

<p>Now her growing popularity and light-mindedness
caused him anguish. Her growing
popularity aroused in him a leaden jealousy.
He alternated from mad blame to pleading
affection. His devotion to her was a continual
pain, and yet in her gentleness she didn&rsquo;t
know how to escape it, and his criticisms bred
in her a certain defiance of the world and of
conventions and made her more extravagant.
I suppose it was because it came as a climax
of a number of smaller follies that the town
took so much notice of the famous &ldquo;Young
People&rsquo;s Party,&rdquo; given by the gentle Mr. Sylvester.
I well remember the next day. I see
myself demure in my grandmother&rsquo;s kitchen,
demure and gingham-aproned, my hands in
dough, my hair sleek under its net. I see Ellen,
a blue ribbon around her hair, a sparkle in her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>89]</a></span>
eye, her little feet crossed, with all the look of
the cat which has swallowed the canary, and is
glad of it. This is what sin had brought her to,
you see. Mrs. Payne sat, sweet and helpless-looking,
in one chair, and my grandmother
creaked portentously back and forth, her hands
folded on the place she called her waist-line,
saying to Sarah Grant:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It couldn&rsquo;t have been <em>hens</em>, Sarah.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was hens,&rdquo; said Miss Sarah accusingly.
&ldquo;They went out to the hen-yard and brought
each hen into the house, and they flew around
and broke two vases.&rdquo; Her eyes meantime had
not quitted Ellen, who at this inopportune
moment snickered with happy recollection.
&ldquo;Ellen,&rdquo; her aunt broke off accusingly, &ldquo;did <em>you</em>
think of bringing those hens into the house?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We were hawking,&rdquo; explained Ellen. &ldquo;I
brought mine in on my wrist and it flew across
and perched on John Seymore&rsquo;s shoulder.
That&rsquo;s how we told off partners for &lsquo;Authors&rsquo;;
everybody got a hen, and on whichever boy&rsquo;s
shoulder it perched,&mdash;and often it wouldn&rsquo;t
perch,&mdash;that&rsquo;s what really happened.&rdquo; She
laughed; her mother laughed; I laughed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>90]</a></span>
Whoever reads this will sympathize with
Aunt Sarah, because it doesn&rsquo;t seem witty for
a grown company of young men and young
girls to have behaved that way in the house
of their minister. It had been a golden moment,
I assure you,&mdash;a party that stood out;&mdash;and
if ever the laughter of the Greeks was
heard in that staid, old New England town it
was when Ellen Payne stood aloft on the hassock,
a squawking hen trembling indignantly
on her wrist; and she at that moment looked
both beautiful and absurd. Miss Sarah Grant
saw nothing of all this.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am chagrined,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Have you
no respect for life?&rdquo; And she walked away
heavily.</p>

<p>Ellen spent the afternoon gathering expiatory
pond-lilies of which her aunt was as a
rule fond. She waded in the pond during the
whole afternoon, her skirts trussed up scandalously,
emerging with a stocking of black mud
on either foot. She was sunburned, she was
mosquito-bitten, she was happy, she sung
aloud for joy on her way home; and when she
left the offering at her aunt&rsquo;s door, this lady
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>91]</a></span>
said: &ldquo;These are very pretty, Ellen, and I
thank you, but I wish, my dear, that you had
made me some little gift that is a testimony
of your industry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was on our way home that we were stopped
by some women from the other church, who
asked me:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Roberta, is it really true that you and
Ellen started to bring in <em>hens</em> to the <em>minister&rsquo;s
house</em> at the Young People&rsquo;s Party?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Roberta never started it,&rdquo; said Ellen, who
was easily drawn in ways like this.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We thought they were joking when they
told us,&rdquo; said Mrs. Mary Snow, who was a
widow and very precise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Miss Amelia Barton, &ldquo;I should
think Mr. Sylvester would have prevented
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Sylvester enjoyed it, the fowls enhanced
the party,&rdquo; said Ellen. I pulled her
along. &ldquo;Hateful gossips,&rdquo; she said. As we
passed the house where Edward Graham was
living, this illustrious young man joined us for
the purpose of saying:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You remember, Ellen, I told you at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>92]</a></span>
party, when I first saw you coming in with the
hen, that you had far better leave it outside.
The whole town is talking and buzzing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The whole town disgusts me deeply,&rdquo; cried
Ellen, &ldquo;and so does any one who lets the buzzing
reach my ears.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You ought to want to know the reaction
of the things you do,&rdquo; retorted Graham, whose
belief in his moralities made him irritable when
attacked. &ldquo;You are criticizing Mr. Sylvester
for permitting it and I think you went much
too far.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When Edward Graham moralized on the
subject Ellen replied flippantly:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is that you and everybody else criticize
anything you&rsquo;re not used to. What&rsquo;s the harm
in hens; what evil does bringing a hen into the
minister&rsquo;s house lead to? Does it make you
want to go and take the amber beads off a
baby&rsquo;s neck just because I brought in a hen
and it perched on John Seymore&rsquo;s shoulder?
John Seymore didn&rsquo;t mind it, and he&rsquo;s studying
for the ministry. It is people like you, who
talk about an innocent thing like a hen, and
fuss over it as if it was something bad, who do
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>93]</a></span>
harm,&rdquo; cried Ellen; and she swept me along
with her. She comments in this fashion about
the episode:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;At the party we were all very happy, and
there&rsquo;s no rule that says that a thing must be
of a worthy sort before we may laugh at it.
That&rsquo;s one of the nice things about laughing,
there&rsquo;s no rhyme or reason to it. It was not
among those things that mother talks of that
undermine our fineness of perception. But Mr.
Sylvester didn&rsquo;t realize how people were going
to feel about it, and now they are all talking
and tongue-wagging as though something terrible
had happened. Am I wrong, or are they?
I think they are, and I hate them for it, and
I feel as though that was the worst thing I had
done, because I hate poor Edward Graham and
I hate Mrs. Snow and Miss Barton because of
their smallness and injustice; and aren&rsquo;t they
more wicked to talk about innocent things and
gossip about young people and make those
who are happy feel uncomfortable and sinful?
It makes me want to break a window when I
think how virtuous they feel.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>94]</a></span>
We hadn&rsquo;t heard the last of the talk concerning
the &ldquo;Hen Party.&rdquo; Rumors of it reached
our ears from all sides. I suppose our elders
exaggerated the talk, that we might learn decorum.
Personally I could not imagine, any
more than Ellen could, just what harm the
hens had been supposed to have done us. One
of the hardest things for me now to understand
is the annoyance so many people feel at the
sweet, noisy fun of young people. It seems to
me the very laughter of fairyland, but older
people have a way of turning the fairy coach
of mirth into a pumpkin drawn by mice, and
are proud of themselves for doing this.</p>

<p>It is strange that the ages of men have rolled
on one after the other without this being a
basic principle laid down to all parents&mdash;you
can&rsquo;t disapprove a child into the paths of virtue
any more than you can scold a man into
loving his wife.</p>

<p>There are a great many young people who
are made reckless and sullen by such disapproval,
though Ellen was saved from the harm
that Edward Graham and the public opinion
of which he was the voice might have done her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>95]</a></span>
by the utter sympathy of her little mother.
She joined in all our little gayeties; she laughed
with us. So did Mr. Sylvester. He attended
the next two or three young people&rsquo;s parties,
explaining to Ellen with his gentleness: &ldquo;They
say, my dear, that I&rsquo;m not a fit guide for youth,
so I am going to try and learn to be so by being
more with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Of course, for their pains, these two grown-up
children of God were called overindulgent; it
was prophesied that they would spoil us; yet
it was this that kept Ellen&rsquo;s audacities always
sweet.</p>

<p>However, even so, Ellen&rsquo;s future destiny was
despaired of by Edward Graham.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ellen is in danger of becoming a jilt,&rdquo; he
told me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She can&rsquo;t help it if people like her,&rdquo; said
I; for I, myself, had changed a great deal from
that rigorous opinion that one should be proposed
to only by the man one intends to
marry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ellen has altered very much in the three
years I have known her,&rdquo; said Edward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She has grown up,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>96]</a></span>
&ldquo;She has not grown up in the way I hoped
to see her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, why don&rsquo;t you turn away your eyes
from the offensive spectacle?&rdquo; I asked him
cruelly, not knowing that this&mdash;poor fellow&mdash;was
just what he couldn&rsquo;t do. But even I was
inclined to agree with Edward Graham.</p>



<p class="padtop"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>97]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>


<p>The old Scudder place in those days was
full of laughter and young people. We were
happier there than any place else, and I have
never known any parties gayer than those,
where the only refreshments were weak lemonade
and occasionally a batch of cookies. I
remember once or twice on great occasions
Miss Sarah Grant provided &ldquo;refreshments.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There came a time when I agreed with
Edward Graham that Ellen was going too far.
This night I remember we were playing hide-and-seek
all through the house&mdash;and you may
be sure it was only in little Mrs. Payne&rsquo;s house
that such a thing would be allowed; for, oh!
how sacred the guest-room in my day and how
solemn and suggestive of a funeral the parlors
in all the rigor of their horsehair. The Scudder
house was a magnificent place for hide-and-seek,&mdash;the
ell connected with the front of the
house by what was known in my day as a
&ldquo;scoot hole,&rdquo;&mdash;sort of a half-sized door,&mdash;and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>98]</a></span>
more doors opened from downstairs to the
outside air than any house I have ever seen.
I was hiding in one of the rooms when I heard
the sound of running, and Ellen dashed in, John
Seymore in hot pursuit, Ellen&rsquo;s laughter trailing
out gay-hearted, careless, and irresistible.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, I&rsquo;ve got you,&rdquo; cried John Seymore&rsquo;s
voice; and to my horror and scandal, he kissed
her and Ellen merely laughed, laughed as she
might have had she been ten instead of twenty,
having run away breathless from a kiss that
she expected to get in the end, and over which
she was only making a mock panic. It was a
romping sort of a performance, because Ellen
had slipped away from him without any sentiment,
but I was shocked and pained&mdash;and,
besides, I liked John Seymore and he liked me,
and I didn&rsquo;t think such levity was becoming
in one who was to become a minister. I sought
Ellen out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I saw you,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I heard you under the bed,&rdquo; said Ellen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why you went out?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to embarrass you,&rdquo; said she,
grinning a naughty little-girl grin at me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>99]</a></span>
&ldquo;You ought to be ashamed,&rdquo; I admonished.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do I look it?&rdquo; asked Ellen.</p>

<p>Suddenly there rushed over me most poignantly
the memory of all our immature aspirations
for the uplifting of those we knew. In
a great wave of sadness I felt that we were
wasting our lives&mdash;and the boy that liked me
most of all had kissed Ellen in a romp. Twelve
o&rsquo;clock had struck for me. I was little Cinderella.</p>

<p>I suppose I must have shown Ellen all I felt,
for she had seen the new look in my eyes and
all her impishness vanished, and she cried out:
&ldquo;Oh, Roberta dear!&rdquo;&mdash;when we both heard
voices shouting:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Alec! It&rsquo;s Alec Yorke!&rdquo; And in
strolled a grown-up youth with wide shoulders,
and a fine, open-air, swinging way with him,
and on top of it was perched the head of Alec
Yorke, only Alec made over with that incredible
change that comes between fifteen and
eighteen years. He was a man grown, but from
this face, so masculine in its youthful quality,
looked the touching young eyes of Alec, blue
and sweet, and fearless, angry blue. He was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>100]</a></span>
seized with a dumb shyness and shook Ellen&rsquo;s
hand over and over again, while his eyes rested
on her as if the sight of her fed the soul of him.
After a while they drifted off together. Ellen
wrote about this meeting:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell how strange this meeting with
Alec has been. It was as though my dearest
friend had been changed over and I had to find
<em>my</em> Alec in this new grown-up boy, who was
the same and so different; even his voice was
different. And then all at once he began to tell
me how much he cared for me, and I feel so
ashamed. I feel ashamed just because he says
that the memory of what I am like has kept
him from doing things that he shouldn&rsquo;t; he
said I&rsquo;ve always seemed to him like a white
light burning in his life. I seemed to myself so
very silly. I have never had any one talk to
me as he did. Every one else who has cared for
me has wanted something for themselves and he
wanted nothing. I know now that I&rsquo;ve never
cared for any one in my life, for the way I care
means nothing compared to the way he cares for
me. What little bit of love I had for Edward
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>101]</a></span>
was nothing. I feel ashamed because I know so
little beside this boy who is so sweet and knows
so much. He doesn&rsquo;t even expect I shall care
for him. He only wants to make me proud that
he should have ever cared for me, and to be
something just for that. The things he said
were all very young and very quixotic, perhaps,
but how much more beautiful than the things
that older spirits think of saying, and if I ever
care for any one, I pray to God that I shall only
think of what I can give. We sat there for a long
time, and he held my hand in his and told me
again and again about myself, and it was as if I
had seen a reflection of the me that I might be
and that I ought to be in the dear things he said;
and when I said: &lsquo;Oh, Alec, you don&rsquo;t know me;
you have forgotten me,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;I look at you,
Ellen; you&rsquo;re sweeter than you were, sweeter
than even I remember you.&rsquo; But everything he
said he said in just a few words that were hard
for him to say, but each little, difficult sentence
had his true self in it, as though he had distilled
his soul for me, and I am so light-minded and
have been so careless and I have tried so little,
but if any one can feel about me as Alec does, I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>102]</a></span>
can try, even though I can&rsquo;t care for him, to be a
little bit more the person he thinks I am. I have
found the only reason I&rsquo;ve ever yet found for
acting the way people want you to act, and that
is to please the ones you love. Some of the foolish
things you do may hurt some one you really
care for. Roberta was shocked because John
Seymore kissed me; but I know we were just
romping, and at most, perhaps, I was a little
bold. It is funny that just a little boy should
open my heart so. Mother and Mr. Sylvester
love the me I am, or rather a younger me&mdash;the
naughty little girl whose naughtiness they know
don&rsquo;t make much difference; but somehow he
has seen the sweetest person I ever am. I feel I
have been a long way off from her, just being
trivial and playing the same game over again
and not going on. I haven&rsquo;t felt before for very
long that Life was a glorious battle, and that
every day, and all one&rsquo;s days, one must fight an
obscure and ever-encroaching enemy. I&rsquo;ve got
to go back to the mountain. I have been seeing
things close to and putting the emphasis on little
things. I wish I could write a letter to everyone
I am fond of. I think it would go like this:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>103]</a></span>
&lsquo;Dear People: I am going to make you a present
of all the small things I do that you don&rsquo;t like.
It will be the things I do, not the way I feel, but
when I feel so happy that I want to run down
Main Street, I won&rsquo;t run any more. I don&rsquo;t think
these little things matter, but as I haven&rsquo;t many
things to give, I give you my foolish impulses.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>I can&rsquo;t say that I remember any marked
change of action in Ellen because of her change
of heart, and I still had that rather breathless
feeling when I perceived that she was what she
called &ldquo;happy in her feet,&rdquo; by which she meant
that then it was she was so happy that she must
go romping through our staid, little town, a
graceful harlequin.</p>

<p>It was just now, however, that she learned
something about Miss Sarah Grant that touched
her and made her wish to put her newborn feelings
toward life into immediate action. Miss
Grant, who had always lectured us severely,
it now seemed had defended Ellen against all
comments.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I enjoy the child&rsquo;s high spirits,&rdquo; we found
her to have said. &ldquo;This town should not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>104]</a></span>
expect conventional actions from the Grants in
inessentials.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Finding this out, Ellen said to me:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She wants a sign of my industry; I&rsquo;m going
to <em>buy</em> her something beautiful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What with?&rdquo; I asked, because actual money
was scarce in the Payne household, and their
tiny income was eked out by trading eggs and
other things at the store; for in a day when
most people raised everything themselves it
was desperately hard for two ladies to make
actual money.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; considered Ellen, &ldquo;Mrs. Salesby has
gone away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Salesby was a gentlewoman who copied
Mr. Sylvester&rsquo;s sermons, his handwriting being
quite illegible. The sum paid for this work was
trifling, the work demanded, long and laborious,
and Ellen&rsquo;s handwriting I might call temperamental.
Mr. Sylvester was at this time having a
book of his sermons, which he called &ldquo;Thoughts
on Life,&rdquo; copied. So for long hours Ellen shut
herself in Mr. Sylvester&rsquo;s dust-covered study
and copied the inspired wanderings of his spirit
which was what his sermons really were.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>105]</a></span>
Living in such intimacy with his thoughts
had a further effect on her mind. They were the
musings of a mystic who was not too acquainted
with the infantile tongue which mysticism must
perforce employ since it forever and ever has
tried to impress the emotions for which the
spoken language has not yet coined exact
phrases. Something of his inner meaning came
to Ellen. She worked on with a serene joy.</p>

<p>At this time also Edward Graham ceased to
be a disturbing presence in her life; for feeling
the need of showing Alec the sort of a girl she
was she told him her whole little story and
he had applied to it the youth&rsquo;s rule-of-thumb
logic and saw the thing as it really was. He
gave Ellen the first sensible talk she had ever
had on her relations with men.</p>

<p>As for Ellen&rsquo;s calm acceptance of Alec&rsquo;s devotion,
she used the sophistries with which women
from all time have accepted the sweet, undimmed
love of those whom they consider boys.
&ldquo;He would, of course,&rdquo;&mdash;writes the candid
Ellen,&mdash;&ldquo;have cared for some one anyway at
this time, and it is better that he should care for
me because I place real value on his affection
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>106]</a></span>
and try myself to be good so that I shall never
hurt them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Through months of toil she had at last acquired
the few dollars necessary to buy the
present, and something &ldquo;boughten&rdquo; at that
moment had a tremendous value. Gifts were
much fewer, and such gifts as there were
were of course made at home.</p>

<p>The first afternoon after her long task was
over, Ellen went up the mountain to reflect.
Our mountain and our river were two things
which moulded the souls of us. The austere
mountain drew my eyes toward God, and how
often I lost my personal grievances as I mingled
my bemused little spirit in the swirling river,
which, after one looked at it long enough and
steadily enough, seemed at last to absorb one in
itself and float one down seaward. I knew that
Ellen was on the mountain and Alec and I
walked up to meet her. She was on what we call
&ldquo;Oscar&rsquo;s Leap,&rdquo; a place where the mountain
seemed cleft away above the river, as though
with some giant&rsquo;s knife, and just above there
was a clear platform, surrounded by trees and
bushes. Our tradition had it that Oscar, one of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>107]</a></span>
the chiefs, leaped his horse into the river below
to escape from his enemies.</p>

<p>This night the river was turned to a mighty
sheet of burnished crimson, as the sun set just
beyond the black bulk of the mountain. Our
peaceful town took on an apocalyptical aspect.
One felt that among the serene silence of departing
day, the end of the world had come,
and in some way the very silence of its coming
made it more awesome, for its color demanded
cataclysmal sounds. Ellen said once: &ldquo;It tears
one through like the noise of trumpets.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Presently Ellen came down the road toward
us, the last slanting rays of the sun outlining
her in the light. She didn&rsquo;t see us as she came
toward us, as we stood in the shadow. As I look
back at that time it seems to me that she forever
moved in a pool of light that came from
the radiance of her own spirit. There was a little
hush over both Alec and myself.</p>

<p>He said: &ldquo;She is very lovely.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And I answered: &ldquo;She has been on the mountain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I felt, indeed, as if Ellen had gone there to
commune with God.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>108]</a></span>
&ldquo;When I came from the mountain to-day,&rdquo;
she writes, &ldquo;the world had a new look, as if I
had never seen it before. I wish the river had a
face so I could kiss it. I had to hold my hands
tight so that I shouldn&rsquo;t fling them around the
necks of Alec and Roberta; I took it for a good
omen that the two that I love most should be
waiting there for me. I have made a wonderful
friend. Though I have never seen him before,
yet I have known him always. I was sitting
above Oscar&rsquo;s Leap, thinking hard, meditating
on the beautiful things in life, which if you
think hard enough about, Mr. Sylvester says,
you will become like, but to do this you must
feel like a little child, very small and humble and
believing. I think I was nearer feeling this than
I have since I was really little, when I looked up
and saw him standing there. I had been thinking
so hard I hadn&rsquo;t heard him come even; he
was just there as if I had thought him into life,
and I was no more afraid of him than as though
I had always known him, although a stranger
frightens me as a rule, unless I&rsquo;m feeling foolish.
He said: &lsquo;I have been watching you a long time;
I&rsquo;ve been watching you think&rsquo;; and I just smiled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>109]</a></span>
at him and he sat down there beside me, and
then it was as if all the things I had never been
able to say to any one came to me, crowding to
my lips. I don&rsquo;t know if I said them or not, because
I don&rsquo;t remember exactly what we talked
about. We made friends the way children make
friends. I felt that if I knew him a little more
only, he would know me more as I am than any
one in the world, because the me, that my own
people know, is so mixed up with that gone-forever
person that used to be myself. I wish
I could remember more what we said to each
other, but the meaning of them is like Mr. Sylvester&rsquo;s
sermons&mdash;we haven&rsquo;t got words for
them yet; but I remember one thing that seems
to me like the truth of truths. He said to me,
&lsquo;Ellen, I am coming back to find you; it was
more than chance that led me here this afternoon.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

</div>

<p class="caption">SHE IS VERY LOVELY</p>

<p>In all that she writes about him during the
next two weeks, where he crosses and recrosses
the pages of her journal continually,&mdash;for she
wrote an almost day-to-day account, Time at
that moment held its breath and gave her space
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>110]</a></span>
to look at the treasure that had fallen into her
hands,&mdash;she never once mentions the word
&ldquo;love.&rdquo; She merely waited for the coming of her
friend. During this time little bits of their conversation
creep out. They had told each other
exactly nothing about their lives, drowned as
they had been in the poignancy of their encounter.</p>

<p>I thought in my innocence that the white
radiance of her, that was so apparent to me who
loved her so, was the blossoming of religion in
her spirit. One afternoon we had been notified
that Ellen&rsquo;s gift had come for her aunt. It had
been sent direct from the city, very beautiful
toilet and cologne bottles, I remember it was,
of the massive kind with which ladies&rsquo; dressers
were then always supplied. We had it all
planned that we were to sit there while Miss
Sarah undid her parcel, and finally, after she had
wondered who could have sent her this gift, with
a gesture Ellen was to tell her, but while Miss
Sarah was about to open the parcel, the wide
door of the stately drawing-room opened. A
young man was framed in it. He stood there
looking at Ellen, who was sitting on a low
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>111]</a></span>
hassock; she looked at him. It seemed to me that
a breathless silence elapsed before Miss Sarah
looked up, while these two talked mutely. I
have only one other time in my life seen a look
on any human face that was like hers. It was
that of one who in another minute must hide
her face in her hands to screen her eyes from the
sight of the glory of the Lord.</p>



<p class="padtop"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>112]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>


<p>Thus they stood through an eternity of understanding,
which in the actual flight of time
was only the moment that it took for Miss
Sarah to turn around, but it seemed to me that
her glad little cry of surprise: &ldquo;Why, it must
be Roger!&rdquo; was echoed deep in Ellen&rsquo;s heart;
and turning to Ellen she said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is Mr. Roger Byington. You remember,
Ellen dear, I told you he was going to stay
with us.&mdash;But what a surprise&mdash;we didn&rsquo;t
expect you until this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I started a day earlier so that I could walk
over the mountain. I walked the last stage.&rdquo;
He looked at Ellen, whose eyes had never once
left him and who had the look of having seen
a miracle. So poignant seemed her look to me,
so much did it tell me, that I remember I had
the wish to stand between her and this strange
young man, so that her heart shouldn&rsquo;t be revealed
to him, and between her and her Aunt
Sarah, so that she would notice nothing; but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>113]</a></span>
I might have spared myself the pains. In a
moment Aunt Sarah was leading him away to
seek for Mr. Ephraim Grant.</p>

<p>I knew without Ellen telling me that this
must be her friend of the mountain. She had
told me about him in all na&iuml;vet&eacute;. It had seemed
to me sort of an Ellenesque thing to have happened,
charming and delightful, though I had
paid no attention to her belief that he was
coming back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you know Mr. Byington was the one,
Ellen?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p>She shook her head. &ldquo;How could I guess?&rdquo;</p>

<p>We had been told that old friends of Miss
Sarah&rsquo;s had written asking for a boarding-place
for their son, who was reading law after
his return from abroad and wished a quiet place
where he might study, and that Miss Sarah
had invited him to stay at her house, but naturally
I had not connected him with Ellen&rsquo;s
stranger.</p>

<p>Once in a long time things turn out the way
that we dream that they will. Once, perhaps,
in a lifetime all the dreamed-of and expected
things focus themselves into one full moment.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>114]</a></span>
At such times the doors of our spirits open and
we find the hidden roads to the spirits of others,
and this was what happened to Ellen. Instead
of Roger&rsquo;s arrival dimming her present, everything
came about as she had planned and it all
worked in together into one marvelous day.
For once Age understood Youth, for when
Miss Sarah learned how this money had been
laboriously come by, she said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ellen, you have the heart of a child, for
only a child would have treasured up my word
that I meant and didn&rsquo;t mean, and I think, my
dear, I&rsquo;ve often scolded you for this very reason.
You are a darling child, Ellen, but a trying
one, and I hope you&rsquo;ll never grow up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When Roger came back with Mr. Grant,
&ldquo;Look, young man,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Do you know
what this is? This is one of the rarest things
in the world; it&rsquo;s a true gift. You have probably
never made one in your whole life; you
and your family go in and plank down your
money and buy something pretty and go away.
Now, whenever I look at this, Ellen, I shall
think of your patience and self-denial,&mdash;yes,
and your industry, and oh, dear, dear! I shall
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>115]</a></span>
never be able to scold you again, which, as I
know, you will often deserve.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We sat there for a half-hour and I felt as
though I were in the midst of a story, with my
Ellen for the heroine.</p>

<p>Roger won us all that afternoon. In conversation
he was the most delightful person in
the world. There was about him a certain,
subdued arrogance when he wasn&rsquo;t talking,
which changed when he smiled into the most
delightful sunny winsomeness. He listened to
those much older and those much younger
than himself with an absorbed interest that
gave the speaker the sensation of saying something
of deep interest. Later we learned that
this young prince and a trying bad little boy
were the same person, but that day we only
saw the young prince. I know that I myself
had the impression of having had the window
of Life suddenly thrown open wide, for with
unconsciousness of what he was doing, he took
us sweeping up and down the world. He had
traveled a great deal in a day when traveling
was much more of an adventure, and he had
had adventures and real ones, as one of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>116]</a></span>
temperament would be bound to have. He
made one feel that one was living with a higher
vitality, as Ellen did, and the way Ellen affected
me then and later was as though she
were a beautiful jewel that I had seen in the
sun for the first time. On this first day she sat
there shining with soft radiance and saying
almost nothing, becoming, it seemed to me,
transfigured before my eyes.</p>

<p>After a while Ellen rose to go, and Roger
accompanied us, and I had to stay with them,
having no pretext for leaving, as my house was
beyond Ellen&rsquo;s down the street; but it seemed
to me that, without meaning to, they subtly
shut me out by the very way that they included
me in their laborious conversation, for
as soon as we three were walking down the
sidewalk, under the great double row of elms
which bordered our street, their touching
courtesy made a stranger of me as nothing else
could have done. Ellen wrote:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;The first thing he said to me when we were
alone was, &lsquo;Ellen, I thought you were a little
girl and you&rsquo;re grown up. When you meet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>117]</a></span>
strange men on the mountains and they say
to you politely, &ldquo;May I ask your name?&rdquo; do
you answer, &ldquo;Why, I am Ellen&rdquo;?&rsquo; I had forgotten
that I had said that. I suppose I did
look young, with my hair down and my brown
dress that&rsquo;s so much too short for me. &lsquo;I came
back to find a wonderful little girl; where is
she?&rsquo; I answered,&mdash;and my heart was beating
at my boldness,&mdash;&lsquo;She grew up while you were
away.&rsquo; &lsquo;Oh, Ellen, Ellen!&rsquo; he said to me, &lsquo;those
were the longest weeks in all the life I&rsquo;ve lived,
and it&rsquo;s strange it should have been your aunt&rsquo;s
house that I should have come to. It is as if
I had been led by the hand, first, to you on the
mountain, and now, to you here.&rsquo; And then
he looked at me and said, &lsquo;Ellen, you focused
all my life for me that day on the mountain.
I&rsquo;ve spent two weeks clearing from my life
worthless trash, all the d&eacute;bris that a man accumulates
living as many years in the world
as I have.&rsquo; And he has really lived in the world,
ever since boys here are nothing but boys.
He told me, &lsquo;When I went by I stopped at our
place on the mountain. Have you been back?&rsquo;
&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; I said, and I looked down. &lsquo;Look at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>118]</a></span>
me,&rsquo; he said, and it seemed to me he drew
my eyes to his. &lsquo;Have you been there often?&rsquo;
&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo; &lsquo;How often, Ellen?&rsquo; and I shook my
head. I felt as though I was dying of shame,
for I had been there every day at sunset. What
if he knew how I had worked to get everything
done so I could fly up there at sunset? I felt
as if his eyes were burning down into my
heart and he said, as though he could read my
thoughts, &lsquo;Every sunset I remembered the way
I saw you there. I ought to have seen you
there again, Ellen; I wanted to take you and
fly up there, and I am going to get a good mark
in heaven for having been so nice to your aunt
and uncle, and even to your nice little friend,
for being so terribly in my way.&rsquo; And all of
a sudden he looked like a naughty, bad, little
boy, which made me laugh at him, and made
me feel on earth again;&mdash;and now I&rsquo;m going
to see him at sunset. I feel as if I had never
been alive before. I went in and kissed mother
and she said: &lsquo;Was your aunt pleased with the
present, dear?&rsquo; I had forgotten all about my
aunt and all about the present. It was as though
I had returned from a very far-off country.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>


<p>That afternoon we were all quilting at our
house and Miss Sarah was pleased enough to
give an account of her guest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had a long letter from Lucia Byington,&rdquo;
she said to my grandmother, &ldquo;explaining
that precious scapegrace of a son of hers,
but I can tell Lucia she might have spared
herself the pains. The minute I clapped my
eyes on him I knew all about him, having
known his father and mother. He has all her
charm and her willfulness, with the iron will
and talent of his father. I suppose, because
I&rsquo;m an old maid, I can&rsquo;t understand why a
man can&rsquo;t bring up a high-metaled son, exactly
like himself, without being at odds with him.
But there! He expects his son to start where
he&rsquo;s left off, with all the sobriety and solemnity
of an aged Solomon. And why people
like Lucia and David should expect not to
have trouble with their children, I don&rsquo;t know.
And as for David, he fights his own youth in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>120]</a></span>
the boy. Now the time had come for Master
Roger to stop skylarking over the earth; he
was holding out; leave town he wouldn&rsquo;t.
They had words; he slung a knapsack on his
back and went off, and wasn&rsquo;t heard from for
a week, and then came back as meek as the
Prodigal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>You may be sure that Ellen and I had our
ears wide open to this story, knowing as we
did why it was that Roger had suddenly become
the docile son. We were so self-conscious
that our eyes did not dare seek one another&rsquo;s,
and we sewed together the large, gay squares
of patchwork with the precision of little automatons.</p>

<p>My grandmother spoke up:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Sarah, I half dislike having your
stormy petrel in our little town. I saw him this
morning, and he seemed to me a restless-looking
bird. He&rsquo;ll be turning the silly heads of our
girls next.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me catch him at it, or them, for that
matter!&rdquo; cried Miss Sarah. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s here for
<em>work</em>, and not to worry me with such-like
goings-on! You may be sure that his family
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>121]</a></span>
have had trouble enough with him in such
imbroglios already.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We had tea early and did the dishes and fell
to our quilting again. I noticed Ellen becoming
more and more abstracted until finally
Miss Sarah said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Ellen, try to bring your mind back
to your work. Years haven&rsquo;t taken your habit
of &lsquo;wool-gathering&rsquo; from you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ellen wrote about this:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;When I was a little girl I was more afraid
of the setting sun than anything in the world
and now I know why, for I was waiting always
for this moment to come, when the sun, red
and round and menacing, set right before my
eyes and I stared hopelessly and hopelessly into
it, not able to move. I had that awful leaden
feeling of wanting to move and not being able
to, as though I had been quilting through the
ages and listening to stories about Roger, a
strange and distorted Roger, who was as infinitely
far away from me as the sun, and yet
that I must go to him. I knew he was there at
Oscar&rsquo;s Leap, and I felt as if he called my soul
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>122]</a></span>
out of my body and my body suffered. I tried
to tell myself that there was to-morrow. I
tried to tell myself how foolish I am to be so
broken in two that I must needs go and keep
my word with this man that I&rsquo;ve seen only
twice in my life; but though I have only seen
him twice, I&rsquo;ve known him always, as I said
before. There&rsquo;s no friend as dear and close as
he in all the world. Oh, beautiful day that I
can never have! The things that we would
have said to each other to-night, we will say
them another time, but not in the same way.
This day is lost to me and I can never have it
back again.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>She tells this of the time when next she saw
him:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;It seemed to me as though he leaped at
me, there was such gladness in his face, although
any one across the street would have
said he just walked. He said, &lsquo;Oh, Ellen,
Ellen!&rsquo; as he did before; and then, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve been
waiting ever since I saw you&rsquo;; and then his
face turned stern, and he said, &lsquo;Ellen, why
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>123]</a></span>
didn&rsquo;t you come? Are you like other women;
while I&rsquo;ve been away did that candid, little
girl learn to hide herself and learn to be false
to her word?&rsquo; I thought I should cry; tears
came to my eyes; it seemed so cruel that at the
very first I should fail him this way, and he
saw how I felt and said to me, &lsquo;Oh! don&rsquo;t,
don&rsquo;t, dear.&rsquo; And for a little while we walked
on in silence. &lsquo;Where were you, Ellen?&rsquo; he
asked me; and he stood still in the path and
said: &lsquo;Ellen, are you a coward? What chained
you there? Didn&rsquo;t you hear me calling to you
from the mountain? Couldn&rsquo;t you get up and
walk out of the room? If you had gone and
hadn&rsquo;t come back, what would have happened?&rsquo;
And then he looked at me in a way I shall never
forget, and what he said I shall remember all
my days, for so I am going to live. &lsquo;Ellen,&rsquo; he
said, &lsquo;you and I in our friendship are not to
be tied down by rules. Remember, courage
opens all doors. Ellen, I threw away many
things to clear the road that led to you. Let
us keep on that way, Ellen; put your hand in
mine and promise. We&rsquo;ll walk to each other
straight out of the open door, without fear,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>124]</a></span>
won&rsquo;t we?&rsquo; When I got home, I am so foolish
and I am so weak and merit his friendship so
little, that I cried. I don&rsquo;t now understand why
it was that I stayed this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>In this brave and heady fashion Roger began
his wooing of Ellen. Just as his whole
pose, forward swinging head and relaxed body,
gave one the impression of one ready to make
a forward rush at any moment and seize what
it wanted, so was the action of his spirit. It
was like the wine of life to my Ellen. They saw
the sunset on the mountain together every
night that they could, and he came down the
pasture that led down from the hill, through
the meadow, to the brook back of the Paynes&rsquo;
house. About these things I knew, for Ellen
needed a confidante. Love overflowed her, and
this was no secret, little love which she carried
shyly, a secret lamp by which to light her way,
which she hid as soon as any one appeared;
but this was a flaming thing, as hard to hide
as a comet. It swept her up and out and beyond
herself into that over-heaven that only
the pure in heart can feel when they are in love.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>125]</a></span>
It was only a very short time when she
stopped deluding herself with any terms like
&ldquo;her dear friend&rdquo;; for one of Roger&rsquo;s great
strengths, then and always,&mdash;and I think
to this day,&mdash;was knowing exactly what he
wanted, and taking the shortest way to it, and
to get his desire he was splendid and ruthless,
and beware to any one who stood in his way.</p>

<p>It was about now that she began the habit
of writing what she called &ldquo;Never Sent Letters&rdquo;;
for could she have been with him all
the hours of the day, the day would yet not
have been long enough for her, and they saw
one another what seemed to them only now
and then. She writes to him at this time:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;What did I do with my time before I met
you? The days that I&rsquo;ve spent before you
came have no meaning now to me, and now
that I am away from you the only preparation
is for you. Everything that I see, everything
that I think, all my thoughts, I save them up
and give them to you, tiny flowers from the
country of my heart. I wonder how it is that
you can love me ever so little, who have so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>126]</a></span>
little to give to you who have so much, and the
only bitterness that I know is that what I have
to give you is so worthless. You say that you
love the joy of life in me. I wish I could make
all the joy I feel shine out like a flame. I wish
that I could distill all the love I have for you
into one cup and then give it to you that you
could drink, for entirely and utterly I am yours
and have been yours always and forever, and
so shall always be until I am changed over into
some one else. When I&rsquo;m with you I don&rsquo;t
dare tell you these things for fear that I should
drown you in myself. Take my life and do
what you like with it, for without you it is a
thing valueless to me.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>In this way was Ellen&rsquo;s touching prayer
answered&mdash;that when she loved any one she
wished only to give.</p>

<p>For the time being everything else was
blotted out for her; she had this measureless,
sky-wide joy of giving herself and all day long,
and all the time her spirit went out toward him
in incense. Her days were lost in contemplation
of the wonder which had happened.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>127]</a></span>
&ldquo;From the moment I leave him, I walk
toward him,&rdquo; she wrote&mdash;and in the interim
between she went on apparently with life as
before, and this woke in her a still wonder.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;It is so very strange to be doing the same
things that I was before, but all the work I do
for my mother, every book I read, every word
I speak has a meaning that it hadn&rsquo;t. It is as
though my ear were at the heart of Life and I
heard Life beat.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>


<p>I saw a good deal of her and so did Alec.
Alec at this time was preparing to work his
way through college. Even Roger, who treated
the village youth with the kindly tolerance of
a splendid young prince, treated Alec as an
equal. Alec, of course, gave him the whole-hearted
admiration that generous lad does a
man.</p>

<p>He guessed Alec&rsquo;s infatuation for Ellen, for
Roger was one of those experienced gentlemen
who feel far off any emotional flurry and he
had paired all of us before he had been in town
ten days, and that without having appeared
to observe us. So much was he the over-masculine
that nothing of this kind could come
near him without his senses registering it. He
could mention John Seymore&rsquo;s name in a way
to make me blush and make me wish to stamp
my foot on the ground with outraged modesty.
And as for Edward Graham, it was on his
account that Ellen first learned the terrible
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>129]</a></span>
anguish that love may bring with it, and she
wrote:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;I have learned how foolish I am and how
weak. We were both at Oscar&rsquo;s Leap looking
down into the river. &lsquo;I walked up and down
the earth, Ellen,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;looking for you, and
as I looked from one person to another I said,
&ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s not Ellen,&rdquo; and then I didn&rsquo;t
know your name. I feel that it&rsquo;s strange of
me that I should not have guessed it.&rsquo; &lsquo;Didn&rsquo;t
you ever care,&rsquo; I asked him, &lsquo;for any one for
a moment?&rsquo; &lsquo;No,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;how could I? Once
in a while I saw some one that looked a little
like you and there I waited longer.&rsquo; &lsquo;But
people must have cared for you,&rsquo; I said. &lsquo;Not
really; some people make a game of things like
that, Ellen,&rsquo; he said. And already I felt deeply
ashamed, that though I am so much younger I
should have been so foolish as to think I cared
once. &lsquo;And you, Ellen; you waited the same
way for me, didn&rsquo;t you? The people who cared
for you, you knew weren&rsquo;t me.&rsquo;&mdash;And then I
told him about Edward. He didn&rsquo;t speak for
a long time, and then he said: &lsquo;Isn&rsquo;t there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>130]</a></span>
anywhere on the earth a woman so young and so
sheltered that she doesn&rsquo;t pass from one hand
to another and snatch at love, and give a piece
of herself here and a piece of herself there?
But, Ellen, I thought you were different&rsquo;; and
the deep and bitter shame that rushed over me
then I don&rsquo;t think I shall ever forget. He asked
me a great many questions, and when he found
that I was so little when it all happened he forgave
me. It seems wonderful to me that he
should have waited.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>It seems wonderful to me, as I read this little,
pitiful account, that Ellen with her straight,
clear mind should have let herself be so bemused
as to feel that something was wrong
which her own inner sense had told her was
not wrong, honest as she had always been with
herself. She lived for the first time by another
person&rsquo;s standard for her. She had given him
that most precious thing of all, her inner judgment
of herself. It seems still more wonderful
to me that Roger should have told her such a
story, for he had had love-affairs a-plenty; but
I think he was utterly honest in this, and in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>131]</a></span>
his honesty lay his danger and his charm. New
emotions, as they came to him, came with so
overwhelming a force that they wiped out not
only the old love, but the memory of it, and
when he had fallen in love with the wild sweetness
of Ellen the other experiences in his life
seemed to him only an unimportant outburst of
passion. Yet for her he had the Turk&rsquo;s jealousy:
he wished not only for the utter virginity of
the body, but also for the virginity of the
spirit to such a point that he had to make-believe
that there had been no Edward in her
life at all before he could &ldquo;forgive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They had both imagined that they could
keep their love a secret for a while until Roger
should have done a certain amount of work.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want my parents to love the idea of Ellen
from the first,&rdquo; he told me, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ve been
so at cross-purposes with them that I want to
get back into their good graces a little before
I tell them.&rdquo; And, indeed, for Roger to have
rushed away to a tardy acquiescence of his
father&rsquo;s will and to reappear immediately with
a bride, we understood would strain the patience
of an irascible parent. Just how much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>132]</a></span>
we learned from Miss Sarah, whom we heard
saying:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The boy really seems to have turned over
a definite new leaf. Lucia writes that she has
learned that Roger has not even once written
to that woman, whose entanglement with
Roger worried them all so. She&rsquo;s been ill ever
since he left, and it serves her right, too. A
married woman of her age should have had
better sense than to have let herself be carried
away by an attractive youngster. Young rascal!&mdash;to
go off on such a tangent when he was
apparently just on the brink of making an ideal
marriage. He and Emmeline Glover, you know,
had been sweethearts for a long time when he
got into this scrape.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In such a way were Ellen and I enabled to
piece out Roger&rsquo;s life, and it apparently did
not occur to her to make any comparison between
herself and Roger; for in very truth the
desire he had for her had swept from him all
his former life until it seemed so paltry and
meaningless that it was no desire of concealment
that had led him to speak so lightly
of both of these women. They had walked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>133]</a></span>
across his conversation with Ellen. Ellen had
heard Roger&rsquo;s side of these stories.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This married woman of whom they speak,&rdquo;
she explained to me, &ldquo;was a good friend of
his and very much older than himself, but people
are so evil-minded in this world. As for
Emmeline Glover, he called her a sweet, little,
silver-gray cloud, and another time, a graceful
shadow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We realized, however, that some time should
elapse before Roger should tell his parents of
his new love, or they would think it a weak
passing interest and fail to treat it seriously.</p>

<p>When his interest in a person flagged, he
lacked the coxcombry that makes a man afraid
that his lack of interest has broken a woman&rsquo;s
heart. Quite the contrary, he was apt to despise
them for having shown affection for so
light a cause. In the world of the affections
he related nothing that had happened to him
before to anything which was happening; each
experience was fresh to him, a rising tide that
had no memory of any other tide before.</p>

<p>They might have gone on with their indiscreet
friendship indefinitely, but they counted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>134]</a></span>
without themselves. They were caught up,
both of them, in the fierce moving stream that
sweeps and swings people out of the orbit that
they have planned. It was impossible to both
their natures, under the stress of what they
were feeling, to wish to be guarded. The clandestine
element in their friendship, slight though
it was,&mdash;for Ellen&rsquo;s little mother was taken
into the secret, how could she leave her out;
she needed to spill some of her happiness over
on every one who came near her,&mdash;became
very irksome.</p>

<p>Roger told me that he longed to go down
Main Street shouting: &ldquo;I love Ellen and am
going to marry her; I love Ellen.&rdquo; And he
would say with his naughty, little-boy look:
&ldquo;Whenever I hear Aunt Sarah&rdquo;&mdash;for with
what Miss Sarah called his usual impudence,
Roger called her &ldquo;Aunt Sarah&rdquo; from the beginning&mdash;&ldquo;talking
about what a good boy I am
and &lsquo;high time, too&rsquo;&rdquo;&mdash;and here he mimicked
Miss Sarah&rsquo;s manner&mdash;&ldquo;I want to say to her:
&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you know, you blind old fossil, that
I&rsquo;m here because of Ellen&mdash;Ellen&mdash;Ellen&mdash;Ellen,
the gentle, that you presume to correct;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>135]</a></span>
Ellen, the joyful; Ellen, the glad of heart?&rsquo;
One of the strangest things in life to me is the
impudence of Age, that dares to presume to
touch so lovely a thing as Youth, and especially
the youth of my Ellen. I can&rsquo;t stand it much
longer, Roberta. Think of my knowing and
submitting to my father&rsquo;s standing between
Ellen and me. He&rsquo;s a wise old man, but he&rsquo;s
forgotten things more useful than any that he
knows, and I know them!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And, indeed, he seemed the incarnation of
the splendid and arrogant Knowledge of Youth,
and my heart beat that so splendid a youth
should be Ellen&rsquo;s; they seemed then God-appointed
for each other.</p>

<p>Roger&rsquo;s direct mind found a way out of the
difficulty. They were at their favorite meeting-place,
up above Oscar&rsquo;s Leap, and looking
out at the river which had turned to flame in
the sunset light. Ellen tells about it:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, Ellen!&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;why can&rsquo;t you put
your hand in mine and walk out into the sunset
with me? I often wonder why, when people
love each other as we do, why they let
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>136]</a></span>
anything stand in their way.&rsquo; And then he said:
&lsquo;Ellen, why shouldn&rsquo;t we&mdash;why shouldn&rsquo;t
we walk out together, just you and me to-night?&rsquo;
And I said, &lsquo;Very well.&rsquo; &lsquo;Come, then,&rsquo;
said he; and he held out his hand, and if I had
put my hand in his he would have come with
me, but I thought then he was joking. He said,
&lsquo;Ellen, I&rsquo;m not joking; I mean it. Would I
joke of such a thing? Why should we waste
one moment of what is so beautiful? You belong
to me, Ellen, don&rsquo;t you?&rsquo; And then he
put his arms around me and kissed me so that
I could hardly breathe, and said, &lsquo;Ellen, do
you belong to me?&rsquo; I could only hide my head
on his shoulder and whisper to him, &lsquo;Yes&rsquo;; and
he said to me, &lsquo;Will you come with me, then,
bad girl?&rsquo; And I said, &lsquo;How can I?&rsquo; &lsquo;Think
about it, Ellen,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;think about it. I&rsquo;ll
give you this week to think of it in, and at the
end of the week it&rsquo;s one thing or the other.
You come with me and be married or I&rsquo;ll tell
them all. Am I one to tiptoe around through
life, hiding because a cross-grained old man
who happens to be my father will oppose at
first something he will in the end be glad of?&rsquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>137]</a></span>
He was such a bad little boy as he said this that
I laughed, though he shouldn&rsquo;t speak of his
father this way, I am sure, even though it is
his father&rsquo;s fault. It is a terrible thing when any
one as sweet and as full of the desire to love
people as Roger shouldn&rsquo;t have been understood
by his parents at home. His mother is
very sweet, but she has never known how to
get at him. All the mutinous things in Roger,
and all the times when he wasn&rsquo;t adjusted to
life, should have been loved away and understood
away. He said to me: &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve been good
only since I have known you, Ellen, because
no one has loved me before.&rsquo; People have
loved me all my life, and Roger, who is so
much fuller and better than I, has not had my
chance.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>Here we have the tragedy that all mothers
must face. Their sons, that they have brought
up so tenderly and whom they have anguished
over, bring all their mistakes to the beloved to
be wept over. If you have worn a callous place
in his spirit, the soft hand of his sweetheart
will find it and she will grieve over it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>138]</a></span>
All girls are sure of two things: that they
understand their men better than their very
mothers do, and that they love them better
as well; and every woman in the world, who
is harrowing her soul over her little son that
she is bringing up, may be sure that somewhere
else in the world there is growing up a
girl who is later on going to find any hardness
or unkindness that she has left in his spirit.
When she had known him six weeks, Ellen
could have brought up Roger better than he
had been. It was her first excuse for his willful
idea. At first she didn&rsquo;t take him seriously,
but opposition was the food on which his will
fed. His father said of him that there was almost
nothing one couldn&rsquo;t oppose him into.
He thought out all the practical details. They
could drive to the home of a minister he knew
and be married at once and come back after
two weeks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! why,&rdquo; Ellen wailed,&mdash;&ldquo;why should
we make them all unhappy when all you have
to do is to work a month or two more?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and then a long engagement, and then
a making of my way; I in Boston, Ellen, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>139]</a></span>
you here.&rdquo; It was a moment of terrible conflict
for her. She wrote one of the letters to
Roger she didn&rsquo;t mean to send:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my dear! I told you this afternoon and
I want to tell you again in this letter how sweet
this little hour is to me. It seems to be the
sunniest place in all of life. The world seems
to me to stretch ahead wonderful and splendid,
and the great storms of Heaven whirling
through the sky, and the lightning and the
clouds, and I can hear in my ears the roar of
cities and the big tumult of seas, and here it is
so sweet. Why hurry away from it? Here it
is so safe. The days of one&rsquo;s life when one is
a girl and loves one&rsquo;s man are so few. Oh, don&rsquo;t
hurry me away. Here is sunlight, and out there
where you want to go it seems to me darkness.
I&rsquo;m a little girl, afraid of the setting sun. I
was afraid of it and yet I couldn&rsquo;t help looking
at it in its awful splendor. I couldn&rsquo;t take
my eyes off from it, as little by little it dropped
down behind the mountain, so wonderful and
so inexorable. My heart chokes the same way
when I think of running off in the night with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>140]</a></span>
you. Let&rsquo;s stay here with our hands in each
other&rsquo;s and then quietly go out into life together
without wrenching ourselves away from
so many ties and without rending everything
that links us to this life that we now live.
Every bit of me, [she writes,] all my soul,
all my heart and my mind, and all my body
wants to go with him as he says, but oh! the
needless hurt to them. When I said, &lsquo;Oh! how
could we take our happiness at some one else&rsquo;s
hurt?&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;Listen, Ellen; the hurt is only
temporary&mdash;just for a moment. Supposing
we went to-morrow night and then we came
back after two weeks married. My father, of
course, will like you by and by&mdash;he just
doesn&rsquo;t want any one for me now; he wants
me to go on working and I am working like a
giant, and then we would be free to go where
we want.&rsquo; Oh, it would be so easy! Nights I
can&rsquo;t sleep, and when I do I am always deciding
and deciding over and over again. When
I tell him to remember the talk that it will
mean, he says to me: &lsquo;Are you afraid?&rsquo; I tell
him, &lsquo;No, not for myself; but my mother will
be left behind and there will be Mr. Sylvester
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>141]</a></span>
and my aunt all to bear talk, so we shall be
happy.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>It seemed as if it was an unequal battle, all
the forces of love, and Ellen&rsquo;s own nature even,
waging a conflict with her little, soft heart.
She grew pale under the strain. I noticed it,
but I didn&rsquo;t know the cause, for here was
something that naturally she didn&rsquo;t tell me,
being allied with the forces of order as I was.
She would have given him anything that she
had to give, from her life on, but she could not
bear to deal him out some one else&rsquo;s happiness
with a careless hand. For his lack of understanding
in this she writes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s never known what it is to have a
home or people that you really love about you,
or to be part of things.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>He was clever in his arguments. Ellen
writes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;He fairly argued my soul from my body.
He said to me, &lsquo;Ellen, it is not as though they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>142]</a></span>
didn&rsquo;t want us to marry. It&rsquo;s just better for
us to go together right away. Why should we
waste a blessed year of our lives?&rsquo; &lsquo;How could
I run the risk of being the cause of serious
trouble between you and your father and
mother?&rsquo; I said. &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll have to leave those
things for me to judge,&rsquo; he answered. &lsquo;How
could I interfere with your work?&rsquo; He grew
almost angry at me. Then he threw his arms
around me in that way he has, as though he
would fairly crush my life from me, and he
said: &lsquo;Ellen, Ellen, for my sake do it. I am not
stable; I&rsquo;m weak, and weak with violence.
In you I found all the things that I haven&rsquo;t,
all the sweet and all the true things in life, the
things that I&rsquo;ve been just for a minute at a
time, when I&rsquo;ve been a good little boy. You
don&rsquo;t know me, Ellen. You&rsquo;ve only seen the
me that you made, but you can keep that if
you want to. Don&rsquo;t play with it, Ellen. It&rsquo;s
the most important thing in life for me to keep
the me that you call out. I didn&rsquo;t know I
could be so happy in a quiet place. I&rsquo;ve always
asked of life more and more, more life all the
time and life has meant action, adventure, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>143]</a></span>
danger, and all at once I find in you more life
than anywhere else, and I don&rsquo;t want anything
but you. Ellen, how can you continue this way
to me for an idea, a foolish, bad idea, a taught
idea? That&rsquo;s where you&rsquo;re not true, Ellen.
If you were true, you would just put your hand
in mine and walk away.&rsquo; &lsquo;If there was no one
in the world but you, I would put my hand in
yours and do whatever you told me, but I&rsquo;m
not just I alone,&rsquo; I told him. &lsquo;Well, I am just
I, just I, and frankly in need of you&mdash;and
in need of you right away. Ellen, this conflict
with you is destroying me. By to-morrow night
you must have decided.&rsquo; I feel as though I had
been shaken by a great wind. When I hear him
crying to me, it seems as though he were crying
for the safety of his soul; and yet there
must be something hard in me, because I know
that being without me for a few months more
or less will not destroy a hard thing like Roger,
and all the time my foolish and weak heart likes
to pretend that it believes that this is so. But
yet, how can I get the strength to tell him to-morrow
night that I won&rsquo;t do what he wants
me to? Oh! it is torture unspeakable to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>144]</a></span>
ungenerous in any way to the one whom one
loves. I can&rsquo;t do it. I&rsquo;ve got to go, not because
I believe down deep in me any argument that
he has given me,&mdash;I was strong as those against
it,&mdash;but just because he wants me to, because
I can&rsquo;t help giving him whatever it is he asks.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>Thus goes the age-old cry. She writes to
him:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;Oh! my dear, why will you make me make
you such a sad gift? Oh! my dearly beloved,
must I give to you the peace of mind, even for
a little while, of all those whom I have loved
in the world; and yet, I know myself that when
I give you this that I shall be glad of it. Now
that I have decided, my heart sings aloud.
Somehow all that they will suffer seems small
to me and unimportant beside this great,
sweeping gladness that I feel.... I feel the
way that you feel, nothing matters except
that we should be together. Every day that
we spend apart is a day wasted&mdash;but I can&rsquo;t
think of the rest of it. It isn&rsquo;t so hard&mdash;it
isn&rsquo;t so difficult, after all. We will come back
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>145]</a></span>
and everything will be all right, although I feel
when I say this as if it wasn&rsquo;t I, and that what
carried me along was the black current of a
river on which I was floating, and that I had
been floating on it for always, only thinking
before that I could direct my poor, little boat.
Now I know that it is something quite outside
myself that&rsquo;s swinging me on with the strength
of this fast-rushing stream.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>


<p>I remember that day very well. Ellen spent
the day with me and with Alec, and we all
three lay under the trees together and then
Ellen went on a little tour of inspection. What
she was doing really was saying &ldquo;Good-bye&rdquo;
to the place that she knew and to us. Her eyes
were bright and shining; I suppose she was
thinking, &ldquo;To-morrow I shall be where?&mdash;to-morrow
I shall be who?&mdash;and these dear
people who love me, what will they think?
Not that I care!&rdquo; She was so sweet to Alec
that her loveliness melted his poor heart still
further.</p>

<p>So sweet she was that, with one of those
ironies of fate that are often more cruel than
tragedy, Alec took this time to tell Ellen about
the work he had decided to do. I can see him
as he stood under the apple trees, the sun shining
on his mane of hair, the brightness of his
eager eyes contrasting with his self-consciousness,
while we two girls stood there, each absorbed
in her own affairs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>147]</a></span>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve looked all around life to see what I
could do best&mdash;and I guess I know more about
boys than anything else. I sort of know how
they feel inside all the time. I don&rsquo;t forget.
So I&rsquo;m going to teach &rsquo;em. Try and teach &rsquo;em
the things they want to know most and that
they knock their shins so trying to find the
way to. They have a hard time. I had just
one teacher&mdash;and he led me out of darkness;
and that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m going to do. It&rsquo;s a business,
you know, that means trying to understand
all the time. It&rsquo;s a present to you,
Ellen,&rdquo; he added with his crooked, whimsical
smile.</p>

<p>He was so anxious that we should see what
he meant, and we were so polite and innerly
so blank. Teaching grubby little boys seemed
to us an uninspiring profession for a splendid
youth like Alec. We couldn&rsquo;t know how many
years he had looked ahead. Alec and his gift
to Ellen seem to typify man and woman. Man,
who comes with his bright visions of the future,
bestows the gift of his high dreams on girls
who see nothing in them&mdash;and are polite.
But Ellen was too heart-rendingly sweet that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>148]</a></span>
afternoon to seem anything but understanding.
She was heart-breakingly gay.</p>

<p>After a while we went in together to Mrs.
Payne&rsquo;s house. She and Mr. Sylvester were
standing in the drawing-room with their hands
clasped, and Mr. Sylvester spoke and said,
&ldquo;We may as well tell these dear children first&rdquo;;
and Ellen&rsquo;s little mother said, as shyly as a
girl, &ldquo;Mr. Sylvester and I have found very
suddenly that we have always loved each
other.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He rejoined with his deep simplicity of
manner, &ldquo;Yes, quite suddenly we found out
that we&rsquo;ve been to one another as the air we
breathe, and as the water we drink, and as the
sun that shines.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And so, of course,&rdquo; said the little mother
of Ellen, &ldquo;we will be married.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She stood there violet-eyed, in her neat,
little black dress, as slender as a girl, more
girlish in her looks than many of us for all her
forty years. I don&rsquo;t think that any of the three
of us had realized that people as old as Mr.
Sylvester and Mrs. Payne could live in the
land of romance and could fall in love. Like
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>149]</a></span>
most young people in their early twenties, we
imagined that this great gift of mankind was
for us alone and that it never lightened up the
hearts of those who had already lived and
loved; but as these two stood, hand in hand,
there rushed over all of us the feeling that they
were just great children. The look of wonder
was in their eyes; they had been living for so
long close to the land of enchantment, and
just now had stepped over its borders into its
realization.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We see no reason for delaying our marriage
long. We waited long enough; we&rsquo;ve been
close friends for eight years; and you, little
Ellen,&rdquo;&mdash;he spoke as though speaking to a
little child,&mdash;&ldquo;you have been already like a
daughter to me and like a little mother to my
children.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll help me now, Ellen, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
pleaded her little mother; and it was as though
they had changed places and Ellen were the
older. But Ellen had them folded in her arms,
kissing first one and then the other, and we all
followed suit; and for once the stern conventions
of New England reserve, which held in its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>150]</a></span>
iron grip such sweet and simple spirits as Mrs.
Payne and Mr. Sylvester, was broken through.</p>

<p>Now Ellen had a shining face, now everything
had all been settled for her by Life. She
could not possibly go away and leave her
mother at such a moment, nor, of course, would
Roger ask her this, and for a moment the light
that swept over the country of her heart was
dimmed by the quiet radiance of these two
middle-aged people. Glad-footed she started
off to her trysting-place, and what happened
there was as though the sun had been eclipsed
in mid-heaven, as though the solid earth had
shaken under her feet. She ran to Roger with
this precious tale of her mother&rsquo;s happiness
in her hands, sure that he would understand.
She writes, almost with an unbelief in the fact
that she had herself heard and witnessed:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;He wanted me to go with him just the
same! He came forward to me in that way that
always makes me think of leaping flame and
said: &lsquo;You&rsquo;ve decided to go, haven&rsquo;t you,
Ellen?&rsquo; And when I told him, he said, &lsquo;That
makes it simpler, doesn&rsquo;t it? They&rsquo;ll be so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>151]</a></span>
occupied with themselves that they won&rsquo;t care
what you do. Hooray!&rsquo; And he laughed like
a little boy. I said, &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t understand;
now I can&rsquo;t go; I can&rsquo;t darken her happiness;
my mother needs me&rsquo;; and he stood before me,
looking at me with eyes that burned with anger
of his desire. &lsquo;Ellen,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;decide now, the
long engagement with its perils for you and
for me; my good or their good; our happiness
against a few stitches put in your mother&rsquo;s
clothes.&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t go.&rsquo; He drew me to
him and said, &lsquo;Ellen, are you coming? You
must come&rsquo;; and I felt as if my soul was shuddering
out of my body, as if he tore me in two,
and part of me must go, and I don&rsquo;t know
what there was in my soul stronger than myself,
because all of me never wanted to do anything
more than to do his will, which was my
will, too; but I had to say, &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t do it.&rsquo; I
know now that there are a thousand things
that make up this; Mr. Sylvester being a minister,
it would hurt him to have his daughter&mdash;oh!
what a sweet word&mdash;run away. All
these things, all the tangled and manifold ways
in which my life is woven into those beloved
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>152]</a></span>
of me, and now a thousandfold more tightly
woven than before into the life of this little
place, all held me back where the inner, beating
heart of me cried aloud to go. He stood
there pleading, and he raged with anger; his
words beat me down, shivering, like a heavy
storm of wind and rain. The love of him drew
me toward him, as flowers lift up their heads
to the sun, but something deep down kept
saying, &lsquo;No, I can&rsquo;t go. No, I can&rsquo;t go.&rsquo; &lsquo;Now,
I know,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;at last how little your love
is worth&rsquo;; and then he pulled me to him and
kissed me roughly, and again and again, and
then almost threw me from him. &lsquo;Good-bye,
Ellen,&rsquo; he said; and I cried, &lsquo;Where are you
going?&rsquo; &lsquo;Oh, not far,&rsquo; he said; but I felt as if
his spirit had gone to the end of the world, and
he strode without me down the road. I am
writing like one in a dream, because I can&rsquo;t
see and don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going to happen
to us, and I want to run out into the night and
run to his house and cry under his window
that I&rsquo;ll go whenever he says, but then I know,
if I did that, that at the last moment I would
decide I couldn&rsquo;t go.&rdquo;</p>
</div>




<p class="padtop"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>153]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>


<p>While Ellen was going through these hours
of anguish her mother and Mr. Sylvester sat
in my grandmother&rsquo;s kitchen, a pair of helpless,
middle-aged children, discussing how they
would break the news to Miss Sarah Grant.
They didn&rsquo;t need to explain why Miss Grant
would disapprove of their marriage; she would
disapprove of it just as all the town would,
for it was evident that if Mr. Sylvester was
going to marry again it was his duty to himself
and to his children to marry a &ldquo;capable
woman,&rdquo; and you might as well ask a moon-ray
or a soft breeze in the trees to be capable
as Ellen&rsquo;s little mother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have suggested,&rdquo; said Mr. Sylvester,
&ldquo;that we let Miss Sarah learn of it as we shall
the rest of the town. A simple and efficacious
way has occurred to me, Mrs. Hathaway, of
informing all our friends,&mdash;I shall merely tell
Mrs. Snow and Miss Nellie Lee and then nature
will do the rest.&rdquo; He was quite grave and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>154]</a></span>
simple-hearted as he said this, but I know that
Alec and I did not dare to meet one another&rsquo;s
eyes, for the good man had mentioned not only
two of the most talkative ladies in town, but
also two who had, according to gossip, felt
themselves very capable of taking care of an
incapable but godly man. Mrs. Payne, however,
insisted that Mr. Sylvester should himself
tell her sister of their engagement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; said Mr. Sylvester, &ldquo;I trust I
am a soldier of the Lord, but I confess to a
feebleness in the knees when it comes to confronting
Miss Sarah, for both of us have been
a serious anxiety to her even in an unmarried
state, and what shall we be now when my
housekeeper has gone?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And, indeed, my dear, how do you suppose,&rdquo;
inquired my grandmother whose spiritual
attitude had been one whose hands and
eyes were both raised to Heaven,&mdash;&ldquo;how do
you suppose you are going to take care of the
children?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ellen&rsquo;s little mother considered a moment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall love them,&rdquo; she replied after an
interval.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>155]</a></span>
Mind you, this statement was one of sheer
anarchy in an age when discipline was the
keynote with children and the superstition
still flourished that one could not properly
bring up a child without the rod.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said my grandmother, &ldquo;I suppose
you will love the holes out of their clothes and
love their gingham aprons into being, won&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can depend upon Matilda a good deal,&rdquo;
considered Mrs. Payne; &ldquo;but we have scarcely
had time, dear Mrs. Hathaway, to think of
the material side of the question, and the children
adore Ellen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And so, all together,&rdquo; rejoined Mr. Sylvester,
&ldquo;we shall get along very well, but our only
real trouble is the pain of breaking the news
to Miss Sarah.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said my grandmother, with brisk
sarcasm, &ldquo;if that&rsquo;s all that&rsquo;s troubling you,
I&rsquo;ll tell her myself. I&rsquo;ll go to her and tell her
that there&rsquo;s going to be a family consisting of
two grown people, one grown girl, and three
helpless little children, none of whom realizes
that meals have to be got or housework done.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>156]</a></span>
&ldquo;Or, indeed,&rdquo; rejoined Mr. Sylvester, &ldquo;where
no one is occupied in anything but considering
the lilies, how they grow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Upon this the two smiled at each other, for
they both had the wisdom of the simple in their
spirits. However, it was apparent to any one
what a helpless m&eacute;nage this would be with
the strong hand of Mrs. Gillig, the housekeeper,
removed from it.</p>

<p>The news of the marriage ran through the
town the way fire spreads; from house to house
it galloped, then it would seem to skip a space
and then mysteriously break forth afresh, as
though by spontaneous combustion, and their
interested chatter hid Ellen from herself a
little. She wrote:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;All day I have been receiving calls and
answering questions. A certain sort of vague
envy has mingled itself with a more definite
commiseration and there has been a great deal
of affection mingled with everything. They
don&rsquo;t know. They all talk as though my little
mother were a baby, and so she is. She&rsquo;s a
child of light. She has not grown up and she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>157]</a></span>
hasn&rsquo;t made me grow up, and I hope I shall
never have to, and I want to say to all the
people, &lsquo;Oh, you blind person, you blind person,&rsquo;
when they speak in this half-patronizing
tone of her. I want to say: &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you know
how much more she has than you? My mother
is a happy person to live with; we are poor and
our clothes are patched,&mdash;and sometimes they
aren&rsquo;t even patched,&mdash;and I suppose she&rsquo;s
a poor manager, but I am so glad she is because,
when we do clean, it&rsquo;s because we want
to and not to fight it day and night.&rsquo; All
through this day that&rsquo;s been so busy, when
people have knocked at our door on one pretext
or another, I&rsquo;ve been waiting. All day
Roger hasn&rsquo;t been to see me; it doesn&rsquo;t seem
possible that he can be angry at me or stay
away from me like this; it doesn&rsquo;t seem possible
that he shouldn&rsquo;t understand me. I&rsquo;m
going up to-night to Oscar&rsquo;s Leap. It seemed
to me that all the world had his voice to-day.
Whenever I heard people talk far off, it seemed
to me that I heard Roger; every time some
one knocked on the door my heart leaped and
I thought: &lsquo;He&rsquo;s coming at last.&rsquo; Twice I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>158]</a></span>
walked uptown looking for him, and once there
was a real errand,&mdash;not a make-believe one
like when I was a little girl and wanted to do
something that took me up to Aunt Sarah&rsquo;s;
Aunt Sarah herself sent me, and how my ears
were strained for the sound of his voice, and
there was no sound at all in all the house. Then
I did a thing that was very bold. I sat down at
the piano and opened it and played and began
to sing, hoping he would hear me, while I
waited for the sewing for which Aunt Sarah
had sent me. Then I heard footsteps on the
stair and I knew that they weren&rsquo;t Roger&rsquo;s,
but yet it seemed to me they must be&mdash;so
much I wanted to see him that the very desire
of my heart must call him to me&mdash;but no.
I wonder what has happened; I wonder if he&rsquo;s
angry; I wonder if he&rsquo;s hurt. I couldn&rsquo;t even
ask Martha a word about him; I had to keep
my mouth closed. It is partly my fault that
we have to skulk in this way. It seems a curious
thing that Martha should know if Roger
was in the house somewhere. But surely he
couldn&rsquo;t have been in the house or he would
have come down when he heard me sing. Why
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>159]</a></span>
should I feel ashamed at having tried to make
him hear me? If I can go and call Alec from
outside his house, why is it more wrong for me
to go and call for the one whom I shall love
all my days, and yet somehow I feel that I
shouldn&rsquo;t. There is some deep instinct in me
that makes me know I was wrong.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>I suppose it was because of Ellen&rsquo;s absorption
in Roger that she failed to write an aspect
of these days that stand out to me as one of the
charming memories of my girlhood, for it so
sums up our New England society of that day.
My grandmother had performed the kind office
of announcing the betrothal to Miss Sarah,
and this good woman&rsquo;s reply was characteristic.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;trust Emily to get into
mischief when Ellen gives us a moment&rsquo;s pause,
and what irritates me the most, Sophia, is that
I am not even allowed my just moment of
anger. If I sulk, then there will be talk, to be
sure, so I&rsquo;ve got to go out and countenance
this marriage of those &lsquo;babes of grace&rsquo; as
though it had been my fondest hope. I,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>160]</a></span>
forsooth, have got to go around and smile until
my jaws are fairly dislocated to prevent the
magpie chattering that there&rsquo;ll be; but before
my anger cools I&rsquo;m going down to give Emily
a piece of my mind. When you consider her
refusing a decent, advantageous marriage, and
then becoming sentimental at her time of life,
it&rsquo;s enough to make one&rsquo;s blood boil.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Sarah eased her mind by making remarks
like this to her sister and then said she:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sophia Hathaway and I are going to bring
our sewing and spend the afternoon, because
you&rsquo;ll see that half the town will be here to
find out what&rsquo;s happened.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So there we were, my grandmother and I,
Mrs. Payne, Ellen, and Aunt Sarah&mdash;a solid
phalanx.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll answer,&rdquo; Miss Sarah announced,
&ldquo;no questions except those asked us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Deacon Archibald and his wife were the
first to call. The deacon came in cheerily,
rubbing his hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was such a fine day,&rdquo; said Mrs. Archibald,
&ldquo;that we thought we&rsquo;d repay the many
visits that we owe.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>161]</a></span>
&ldquo;Yes, we are always so remiss in that,&rdquo;
chirped Deacon Archibald.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you be seated? Take this more
comfortable chair,&rdquo; said little Mrs. Payne.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The weather&rsquo;s been fine lately,&rdquo; remarked
the deacon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A fine summer, indeed, for the crops,&rdquo;
agreed Miss Sarah; &ldquo;the tobacco&rsquo;s doing splendidly
in the valley.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There came another rap on the door and
Mrs. Snow was admitted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought I&rsquo;d run in just a moment to see
if you had that mantle pattern,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>Mrs. Butler, stiff with rheumatism, came
next. A knock was heard at the back door and
I heard her heavy breathing and her &ldquo;Well,
Ellen, I just ran over to return your mother&rsquo;s
hoe that Alec left at my house when he hoed
my potatoes for me, but why he can&rsquo;t take
back the tools himself I can&rsquo;t see. Has your
mother got company; invited company, I
mean?&mdash;because, Land Sakes! I can <em>hear</em>
she&rsquo;s got <em>company</em>. I&rsquo;m not deaf.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The question that they all longed to ask lay
heavy in the air. It was good and <i>bona-fide</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>162]</a></span>
gossip that they had heard as coming direct
from Mr. Sylvester himself, but so afraid is
New England of making a mistake and of
committing itself, that two other ladies had
dropped in on an errand of one sort or another,
or for calls, before Miss Sarah took advantage
of a little pause in the conversation to remark:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose every one of you here has come
to find out if my sister is to marry Mr. Sylvester.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a little, fluttering chorus of dissent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; said Miss Sarah, &ldquo;I know
what you wish to ask and what a bushel more
will come to ask before the evening is over,
and that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m staying here; and tell
every one that you meet that we shall be happy
to tell them ourselves that such, indeed, is the
happy fact.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Sarah spoke with a large and grim geniality,
for she always had the air of one who
says, &ldquo;Mankind, I am about to chastise you
for your weakness, but I realize that I am
human as well as you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Meantime my poor Ellen had heard in each
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>163]</a></span>
one of these knocks on the door Roger&rsquo;s knock,
and so she continued to hear the next day.
She wrote:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s gone away, and I have only learned
about it by chance. Just by chance I heard
Aunt Sarah saying: &lsquo;As if it wasn&rsquo;t excitement
enough to have this happen yesterday, that
young scallawag gets up and leaves me at a
moment&rsquo;s notice.&rsquo; Two of his friends came
through, it seems, and Roger left with them.
He left without sending word or sending me
any message. He says he&rsquo;s gone for a day or
two only. Aunt Sarah says she would not be
surprised if he never came back, but that can&rsquo;t
happen. How could it happen? Did he think
that I had failed him so that he doesn&rsquo;t want
me any more, or that I lacked so in courage
and in love of him?... Another day has gone
and no word from him. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever
felt so alone in all my life and so cut off from
all human help. I know it is wicked of me, but
mother&rsquo;s happiness hurts me. I want her to be
happy, but oh! it hurts me to watch it. I wish
I could go off by myself somewhere, and yet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>164]</a></span>
I know that there I will be worse than I am
now, with a thousand small things to do to
somehow fill up the days. Something must
have happened to him. I watch myself like
some other person for fear I shall seem sad for
a moment, for if I do it will look as though I
am not pleased about my mother. Oh! I hope
that I won&rsquo;t hurt their joy in any way. I
wonder how women live who have to wait long
for news of those they love. I seem to move
around in the world, but I really do nothing
but wait. Each time I see my aunt I think that
she will have news of him; I&rsquo;m grateful to her
now if she only tells me he hasn&rsquo;t come. When
I am asleep, I&rsquo;m still listening and waiting for
him. Something must have happened to him,
because he must want to see me as I do him.
It seems to me that no one could hurt any one
they loved as much as this and be alive.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>Here it was for the first time that Ellen
tasted that bitter pain of women, waiting. It
sometimes seems to me that this is an anguish
in which we live and of which men know nothing.
During the course of a long life every
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>165]</a></span>
woman passes so many hours of still agony
when she must fold her hands and smile and
wait. We cannot go out seeking the beloved,
but must sit and wait until he comes. Like
Ellen, when you have had a misunderstanding
it is not yours to run generously forward; you
can&rsquo;t clap your hat on your head and say,
&ldquo;Here, I&rsquo;ll make an end to this; I&rsquo;ll go and
find her.&rdquo; No, you must sit waiting for the
sound of his footsteps coming toward you;
wait until your whole soul is tense; wait until
each sound is part of this hope deferred. All
women know this pain of waiting; and when
our time of waiting for a sweetheart is over,
the sons we love go out into the world, and
again we can do nothing but sit still and wait
for news of the travelers, wait for the little,
scant messages of love which their careless
hands pen to us in some casual moment. The
long days pass and the letters don&rsquo;t come, and
still we wait. We sit and wait for our children
to be born, through the long months, with the
black certainty of the birth that may be death
staring us in the face.</p>

<p>Some women get used to waiting. I think
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>166]</a></span>
that those who do have closed the doors of their
hearts to the keener range of feeling, having
suffered so much that they say to themselves,
&ldquo;Here, I&rsquo;ll suffer no longer.&rdquo; There are yet
others who pass through the pain of waiting,
going by this thorny, bleeding, silent road of
doubt and pain to a higher acquiescence. It
is a long way there, and the heart of us must
weep much in silence before we can attain this
glorified peace. I have known the spirits of
women to snap like the overstrained strings of
a harp, as they waited with smiles upon their
lips.</p>

<p>I am sorry sometimes for all women, and
most of all for the impatient, tender, and flaming
spirits of young girls who meet this pain
for the first time.</p>

<p>It is because we have all suffered in this way
that the most generous among us run so eagerly
to meet those whom they love. Having tasted
this pain, we wish forevermore to spare others
anything like it. The more shallow-hearted
and, perhaps, wiser women, and those who are
not children of light, having tasted it, use the
anguish of suspense as a weapon in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>167]</a></span>
everlasting warfare between man and woman. But
there is hardly a woman grown who could not
echo the cry of Ellen when she wrote:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;I do not dare to go out of the house for
fear I might miss some word of him, and yet
how can I stay in the house knowing my own
thoughts? I wish to fill the gray horror of these
empty hours with anything that the wayside
will bring me; I want to go out and play with
the children; I want to find Alec and walk with
him. I try to remember just one thing&mdash;that
some time to-day or to-morrow, or the next day,
I shall hear something. <em>This can&rsquo;t go on forever;
there has to come an end.</em>&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>


<p>I, with my eyes fastened on the romance
of Mrs. Payne and Mr. Sylvester, had noticed
nothing; the explanation that Roger had gone
off for a few days with friends was enough for
me; but it was Alec, with a keener vision, who
had seen something wrong.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What ails Ellen?&rdquo; he had asked me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;what should?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Roberta,&rdquo; said Alec, &ldquo;is Ellen in love with
Roger?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How should I know?&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>Alec looked down, kicking the dust before
him with the gesture of a little boy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would be natural if they cared for each
other,&rdquo; he continued. Then he suddenly flung
out his hand and said, &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s so, he won&rsquo;t ever
make her happy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Alec, what do you mean?&rdquo; I said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s only thinking about himself; he&rsquo;s
interested only in Roger Byington,&rdquo; Alec declared
with vehemence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>169]</a></span>
He filled these next days as full of himself as
he could; making Ellen laugh at his fantastic
goings-on as he pretended to be the bulletin
which announced how far the gossip had
reached. With his tender second sight he tried
to hide Ellen from herself or whatever it was
that was troubling her.</p>

<p>As Ellen said, the trouble couldn&rsquo;t last forever,
and the end came unexpectedly. While
we were sitting in the orchard I saw Ellen&rsquo;s
hand go to her heart and her face change color;
she sat still a lovely, quivering thing, with all
the soul of her running out to meet Roger, and
he advanced through the sweet clover, swishing
at it with a little cherry wand that he had
cut when walking. He had gone away a fairy
prince&mdash;his only fault had been loving Ellen
too much&mdash;and he came back a naughty little
boy. Even I noticed the change in him. There
was an arrogant, willful tilt to his head which
belied the lightness of his disarming manner,
and one which said: &ldquo;First I&rsquo;ll try to coax you
into good humor, but beware of my stubbornness
if you find fault with me too far.&rdquo; He was
the male that will not admit that he has faults.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>170]</a></span>
&ldquo;Be thankful that I&rsquo;m back at all,&rdquo; was what
his bearing implied; &ldquo;and we&rsquo;ll ignore also
that I&rsquo;ve been away, if you please.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ellen, poor child, had no idea of blaming
him, any more than she had an instinct of hiding
her emotions. Never once had she blamed
Roger, even to herself, for going away, and at
the sudden end of her suspense uncontrollable
tears came to her eyes. Men have written books
about the folly of the tears of women. Who
knows it better than they, poor things? There
are uncontrollable women, of course, who are
as spendthrift with tears as some men of anger.
Tears like these of Ellen&rsquo;s are as unexpected
and uncontrollable as a sudden storm, and I,
knowing what it meant when Ellen cried, left
them quickly.</p>

<p>Ellen wrote about it:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;Oh, the unspeakable shame of having cried.
I didn&rsquo;t know I was going to; I haven&rsquo;t cried
since he has been away; I&rsquo;ve only waited. He
was sweet and tender with me, but he said
whimsically: &lsquo;You, too, Ellen! I&rsquo;ve had many
a tearful home-coming with my mother. If
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>171]</a></span>
one stays away unexpectedly from women, no
matter who they are, the first thing they do
when you turn up again is to find fault with
you or else weep over you.&rsquo; Then he held me
out at arm&rsquo;s length. &lsquo;Ellen, you&rsquo;re not going
to make of me the sinner that repented.&rsquo; I
don&rsquo;t know what leaden weight I have in my
heart; it seems all so different; it&rsquo;s like a little,
commonplace squabble. I&rsquo;m always disappointing
him; he has thought me different from
all other women and I would so like to be, but
I am just the same. He didn&rsquo;t even refer to
the cause of his going away. We talked of this
and that and couldn&rsquo;t find each other. He
looked at me curiously two or three times and
said, &lsquo;Ellen, I thought I should never see tears
in your eyes.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>Here, indeed, was a shifting of base; they
had been playing the higher harmonies that
men and women play together; their spirits
had been in perfect unison; even the tragic
parting had had its undercurrent of understanding,
and now here they were with their
feet on earth; Ellen with homesick eyes for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>172]</a></span>
the land of lost content and Roger with a little
sneer that she should have let him see that she
had no pride against him. Her absence of
coquetry was her undoing. He knew now he
could put her down or take her up at will, and
her price was a few tears. Her spirit stood out
in that moment of welcome, shining and naked,
her little shy spirit, the reflection of whose
light alone had been enough for Alec.</p>

<p>From the point of view of age, it is Roger
for whom I am sorry, for with all courage and
charm and ability and the swift, pulsing flow
of life in him, life had tainted him already so
that this ultimate gift of herself made him
think Ellen too easy of attainment. The situation
was one that had been repeated time and
time again, sometimes by men and sometimes
by women. Roger had had his naughtiness
and his lack of consideration and his sudden
and impatient vanishing out of a difficult situation
treated by tears and reproaches. Poor
Ellen, by her very innocence, had trodden a
path of the emotion familiar to him, since his
way out of difficulties had been a sudden impatient
vanishing. If she could have only had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>173]</a></span>
the inspired sense to have taken his return in
a matter-of-course manner, it would have
piqued him, and again Ellen would have won;
but how play sorry games like this with the
best beloved? One of the sad things of love is
that it is in absurd and trivial ways like this
that it falls from its highest state and loses its
radiance.</p>

<p>From the account of her journal they jogged
along a few days at a slack-water; Ellen groping
forever for Roger, Roger a little bored at
the too-eagerly offered heart; their positions
oddly reversed; Roger rather magnificently forgiving
Ellen for having annoyed him.</p>

<p>Then suddenly into this doldrums of the
emotions burst Miss Grant. A flaming affection
is hard to hide. It shines like a light behind
a closed door,&mdash;let two people walk ever
so carefully. Now the eyes of one follow the
other and the look is a caress; now some one
intercepts an exchange of glances, and that
exchange means, to any one whose heart has
beat fast for love, a promise of everlasting
devotion; you see a girl&rsquo;s hand steal to her
fast-beating heart, or the young man waiting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>174]</a></span>
for her with that aching impatience of the
young.</p>

<p>So gossip had begun about Roger and Ellen.
Some one had seen them walking down the
street so absorbed that they had seen no one
else; another had noticed Ellen walking across
the bridge to the mountain and Roger going
before her. Little by little the people who had
separately observed these things had talked
together until between them they had pieced
together from broken fragments the whole
story, and then, like a picture thrown unexpectedly
on the screen, the gossip of it came
to Miss Grant.</p>

<p>I suppose she had gotten bits of it before,
hints and innuendoes, of the kind people give
who are too pusillanimous to face a woman
like Miss Sarah with a point-blank question.
The whole thing was focused one afternoon
when she had said lightly to Mrs. Snow that
she didn&rsquo;t know where on earth Roger had
passed his time in such a quiet little town.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Sarah, if you spent more time down
at Emily&rsquo;s, perhaps you&rsquo;d know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To Miss Sarah&rsquo;s hot, &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>175]</a></span>
&ldquo;I mean that wherever Ellen is, Roger&rsquo;s apt
to be, and no reason making such big eyes at
me; a very nice sort of thing, I think it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Sarah merely put on her bonnet and
shawl and marched majestically down the hill.
She found Ellen on the back porch, in the
midst of a foam of ruffles she was hemming for
her mother&rsquo;s gown. She towered above Ellen,
an avenging fate, whose gray curls bobbed on
each side of her head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ellen, what&rsquo;s this gossip I hear about you
and Roger?&rdquo; she demanded. Before Ellen had
time to reply, as though she read her confession
in the color that mounted to her face,
&ldquo;How could you do such a thing, Ellen?&rdquo; she
fumed. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know that Roger Byington
came here to work and settle down; don&rsquo;t you
know that he has a marriage already planned?
Don&rsquo;t you see the position you&rsquo;ve put your
family in, that of snatching at the fortune of
an old friend! A fortune that&rsquo;s destined elsewhere,
and that we were bound, you as well
as I, to guard! You&rsquo;ve been deceiving the
whole of us!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ellen rose to her feet and faced her, her sewing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>176]</a></span>
still in her hands, the blue ruffles around
her white frock like a wave of the sea.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve deceived no one, Aunt Sarah,&rdquo; said
she, with a touch of sternness in her voice, and
just here Roger appeared.</p>

<p>He had heard voices, and had heard his and
Ellen&rsquo;s names mentioned, and he had then seen
Miss Grant storming down the hill like some
aged New England Valkyrie and had followed
her. He arrived in time around the side of the
house to catch her last words, and the flaming
anger that any one should scold his Ellen blew
away forever the flatness that had for a moment
assailed them.</p>

<p>He threw his arms around Ellen as though
he would protect her from everything for all
time. &ldquo;Miss Grant,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the reason I&rsquo;m
here in this town is Ellen. I walked through
here one time and I saw Ellen and talked with
her for a few minutes by the roadside, and so
I came back. No one else I&rsquo;ve ever seen in life
matters to me&mdash;nothing else but Ellen matters.
Please remember that if I amount to anything
<em>ever</em>, it will be because of Ellen, and if I fail, it
will be because I have failed Ellen. Had I had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>177]</a></span>
my way Ellen would not have been here now
with you; she&rsquo;d be married to me.&rdquo;</p>

</div>

<p class="caption">SHE TOWERED ABOVE ELLEN, AN AVENGING FATE</p>

<p>Ellen wrote:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what it did to me to have it
talked about in the open. I felt as if I belonged
forever to Roger, as though some way this
outward profession of faith of his brought out
and made positive everything that he had said
and that I had felt, and that we truly belonged
to one another.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>The old lady measured the young people
with an angry gaze.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Young man,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I consider you&rsquo;ve
abused my hospitality; you have put me and
my brother and my whole family in a false
light before your parents. You entangle yourself
in sentimentalities with a married woman,
you play false with your sweetheart, and when
your father wishes you to reconstruct your
life, you throw them both over and place me
in the position of having seemed to connive
at a marriage with my niece. I shall write your
mother my disapproval by the next post, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>178]</a></span>
if Ellen knew as much of your past history as
I do, she wouldn&rsquo;t take this sudden infatuation
seriously, and if she had any dignity she
would withdraw at once from this false position.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your letter,&rdquo; Roger replied with some
heat, &ldquo;will reach my mother somewhat after
my own. When Ellen&rsquo;s love for her mother
overcame her better judgment and she refused
to go with me, I wrote my mother on my return
as I told her I would do; and now, permit me,
Miss Grant, to withdraw from your house
which will save your pride in this matter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was an old-fashioned quarrel that Youth
and Age indulged in, and Ellen&rsquo;s journal gives
more of it, full of stately words and innuendo
and recriminations cloaked in fine-sounding periods,
and I think both Roger and Miss Sarah
enjoyed their own rhetoric heartily.</p>

<p>Mrs. Payne heard the noise of the combat,
and when Miss Sarah realized that her sister
had been, as she said, &ldquo;an accomplice,&rdquo; her
indignation knew no bounds, though she admitted:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do you justice, Emily; you&rsquo;ve so little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>179]</a></span>
common sense that I don&rsquo;t suppose for a
moment you thought of anything but the
sentimentality of this ill-governed young man
and your Ellen. You didn&rsquo;t, I suppose, for
a moment consider that Ellen is not the sort
of a marriage planned for him by his father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Payne&rsquo;s wide-eyed, &ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t
she be? Ellen&rsquo;s so sweet and pretty,&rdquo; collapsed
the older lady&rsquo;s anger like a pricked balloon,
as nothing else could have done. Ellen&rsquo;s picture
of her is this: &ldquo;Aunt Sarah flopped down, she
didn&rsquo;t sit, and gathered her draperies around
her like a wounded Roman matron.&rdquo;</p>


<p class="break">Roger, at Mrs. Payne&rsquo;s words, again put his
arm around Ellen and laughed aloud. He
adored their unworldliness. The bad little boy
in him vanished; so did the man of the world
who cannot bear generosity in the beloved.
He spoke truly enough when he said all the
best things in him ran out ahead of him to
meet Ellen. He said to Miss Sarah gently:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see, we really care for each other, Aunt
Sarah, and I&rsquo;m awfully sorry about putting
you in a false position, but that doesn&rsquo;t count
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>180]</a></span>
very much compared to Ellen&rsquo;s and my happiness,
does it? Please believe me when I tell
you that your side of this never occurred to
me and so I&rsquo;ll take myself away to-night.&rdquo;
The moment of high-sounding periods was over.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t you better stay?&rdquo; asked Miss
Sarah. &ldquo;Think of the talk, Roger.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want talk,&rdquo; he said,&mdash;&ldquo;all the talk in
the world; I would like everybody to know
how I care for Ellen&mdash;I welcome gossip.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;The way he laughed&rdquo;&mdash;wrote Ellen&mdash;&ldquo;made
one feel the way Spring looks; I was
so proud, and wondered more than ever what
I could have done to have any one like Roger
love me.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>During the days when they had been at odds
with life, they had taken pains to have me with
them; it was the first time that they had shown
themselves eager for my company together.
I had been confidante first for Ellen and then
for Roger, and then again for Ellen, but seldom
had I seen them both at once. Now, after this
explanation with Miss Grant, they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>181]</a></span>
unconsciously thrust me aside with no more regard
for me than if I had been a withered flower. I
was going to Ellen&rsquo;s to help with the sewing. I
had left her a little lack-luster, a little wistful;
Roger had been sulky and inclined to cynicism;
and now they swept down on me like a
splendid young god and goddess, no longer
making any effort to keep the town in ignorance;
they took it in in a magnificent gesture,
the way they looked at each other; shouted it
aloud, and, as though to carry out in very truth
the words he had spoken to Miss Grant when
he said he would like to shout through the
town that he loved Ellen, he took her hand in
his when he saw me and swung it to and fro;
and in my day such an action as this was one
which would cause the quiet windows to bristle
with interrogatory eyes. You might be perfectly
sure that there would be quiet slippings
through back doors and gossiping under grape
arbors.</p>

<p>That evening I met Roger coming down the
street and he stopped to tell me:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve had it out with Aunt Sarah, and
both Aunt Sarah and I have written to my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>182]</a></span>
mother. Now we&rsquo;ll soon have an end to this
shilly-shallying.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And if your parents don&rsquo;t like it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;God help them if they don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Any parents I have will <em>have</em> to like it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And there was so sinister a note in his voice
that I shivered. Sometimes when he spoke
there was a weight to a light word that seemed
like a heavy wind.</p>

<p>It was not long before the town had more to
talk about. Mrs. Byington, in her beautiful
and fashionable clothes, was as conspicuous
as though she had come riding in a palanquin.
The city and country were much more apart
in those days, and home-made patterns taken
from some remote city ones were passed from
hand to hand; dolls dressed in Boston still
carried the mode somewhat; and in our honest
village, loveliness was put by with youth, and
lovely was the quality of Mrs. Byington. At
fifty she was tall and slender, her hair a little
gray, her neck graceful like a girl&rsquo;s; she walked
swayingly, and age was not a quality with
which she seemed to have reckoned. With the
changing years she had a quality as compelling
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>183]</a></span>
as youth itself, and this without the slightest
attempt at seeming less than her years.</p>

<p>Ellen writes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;Roger&rsquo;s mother came to see me alone, and
before her, so beautiful and soft, I felt as though
I had been made yesterday. It happened that
I opened the door for her, and I knew who she
was and she knew me, for she said: &lsquo;Dear
child, I know you are Ellen; I wanted to come
by myself.&rsquo; She looked at me with searching
eyes that were a little sad, and all of a sudden
I felt very sorry for her, for it must be very
hard, when you have a son that you love, to
learn all at once that his life belongs to some
one else. We sat down and talked a little, and
my heart beat so that I could hardly say anything,
and I felt that I was very stupid, and
that if Roger could be there he wouldn&rsquo;t like
the way I was acting, and all of a sudden she
put her arms around me and kissed me, and
said: &lsquo;Dear Ellen, you are very lovely and very
perfect, and, indeed, I knew you would be
very &ldquo;something&rdquo; to send my wild Roger after
you at such a rate. You love him very much,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>184]</a></span>
don&rsquo;t you?&rsquo; I couldn&rsquo;t speak, and only bowed
my head; and she said, as though talking to
herself rather than to me, &lsquo;Poor child, it would
be better for you if you loved him less; he
would be more yours.&rsquo; I asked her what she
meant. She thought a moment, and then said:
&lsquo;Perhaps you&rsquo;ll never find out; you&rsquo;re so sweet,
Ellen; even Roger wouldn&rsquo;t hurt a child.&rsquo;
And for a moment I felt a little flaming anger
at her for not understanding him better. I
wanted to tell her that there was only sweetness
in Roger for those who knew how to find
it, but, of course, I didn&rsquo;t dare. There was
something in her tone that made a cold shadow
fall over me.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>It seemed as though all difficulties were
cleared from before them, when Ellen found
herself face to face with what really was the
first important issue of this time. After all, the
things in love that count are not all the obstacles
imposed on us from without. It is
strange to me why people have always written
of these rather than of those far more important
moments, as when, for instance, one first sees
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>185]</a></span>
the beloved face to face as he really is. Love
for a moment makes us transcend ourselves,
and Roger was a brave lover, and Ellen had
known nothing of him except Roger the lover,
when suddenly she caught a new glimpse of
Roger. She wrote:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m going to do&mdash;nothing
I suppose. I&rsquo;ve seen Roger angry with
his mother. It was our last afternoon all together
and she was talking very seriously with
us. She said: &lsquo;Your Ellen is very sweet, Roger.
Keep her happiness, and if you play fast and
loose again, you deserve all the unhappiness
the world can bring you.&rsquo; She has wanted me
to see him as he is, and has talked around the
edges of this, and she said to me, &lsquo;I came here
wondering who you were, Ellen, and ever since
I saw you I&rsquo;ve been wondering what Roger
will do to you in this new life of yours begun
so sweetly.&rsquo; One time she cried out, &lsquo;Oh! why
do women have to marry men?&rsquo; And then
she laughed at herself for saying it. Ever since
she came Roger has been watching her. He&rsquo;s
had a critical attitude and is ready to find fault
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>186]</a></span>
at a moment&rsquo;s notice. It was as if the impatience
of the whole week overflowed. What he
said wasn&rsquo;t so much. Oh! he kept within
bounds before me, but the restrained anger of
his manner was as though he had struck her,
as though he had hurt her, as though the force
of his anger would throw her from the room.
She held up her head a little proudly, but she
only said, as though to bring him to himself,
&lsquo;Roger, Roger!&rsquo; warning him, one would think,
not to lose further control of himself. She spoke
as if she were used to this wounding, terrible
manner, a manner that gets its own way in
spite of everything; and I stood there trembling
inside, and I began thinking, &lsquo;Who are you,
Roger, and who am I?&rsquo; Now it is all at once
as if I had an answer to why she seemed to pity
me, as though she wanted to protect me from
everything. All my instinct is to run and hide
in some place where I shall hide from him forever.
I know nothing of him or he of me.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>


<p>There comes a moment in the life of almost
every one when, bewildered, for the first time
they meet an everyday and faulty person in
place of the beloved. Sometimes this is the
beginning of a long disillusion; it is then that
many find out that one has not been in love at
all, but only in love with being in love. With
young lovers one often calls this first glimpse
the first quarrel. After marriage this slow
torment of becoming accustomed to another
personality in the body of the beloved is called
the &ldquo;time of adjustment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With Ellen this moment was a severe spiritual
crisis. As she had seen concentrated in
the last weeks only the lovable things in Roger,
so in this one moment she had a vision of all
in him that was inimical to happiness and
peace. It was as if that blind, voiceless judge
that sits deep within all of us and bids us love,
hate, or fear, had been aroused to its depth,
and its final judgment of Roger had been that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>188]</a></span>
here was danger. Had there been any place to
run to, she would have fled, but there was nothing
to do but sit still. She dreamed at night
that she saw his face savage in anger, heartless
in its desire, and relentless in its will to get
what it wanted from life; and since she could
not leave home to run away from him, she ran
from him spiritually.</p>

<p>When he came to see her next, he could
hardly find Ellen in the inert and docile person
who presented herself to his gaze. It was as
though the glance he had given his mother and
the tone in which he had spoken had been to her a
prophecy of life to come. She saw him with that
terrible clairvoyance that love gives; she saw
clearly what her life in the hands of this other
Roger would mean; and it seemed as if the
very inner spirit of her struggled to free herself
from his power.</p>

<p>I, personally, fear the shocks of the spirit
as some fear physical pain, and instinctively
I withdrew from the perversities of men, and
I now look shudderingly back on two marriages
which I might have made but for this warning
bell which rang over the reefs of the spirit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>189]</a></span>
Her first movement had been one of flaming
indignation; that burned out, leaving behind
it the ashes of a dull, apathetic fear. When he
asked her what was the matter and why, she
told him she was afraid of him. He called himself
a brute, he apologized to his mother, but
she remained inert and docile, as aloof as a
person who has been stunned by the spectacle
of a great disaster, and, indeed, the flood of
her emotions had ebbed back violently.</p>

<p>In despair Roger came to me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve lost Ellen,&rdquo; he told me. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve
awfully bad tempers in our family, and my
mother didn&rsquo;t understand that since I&rsquo;ve
known Ellen there are a whole lot of things in
my life that I want to forget. The me Ellen
knows is a different me from the one mother
knows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He had never been as sweet to Ellen as he
was now. She had seen before a brave lover
who rushed everything before him and when
he was refused anything would turn into a
naughty little boy. Now he was a tender suppliant
asking for mercy, confessing his sins and
inventing sweet and touching things to do for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>190]</a></span>
Ellen. I think the men of my day were crueler
as men and warmer as lovers. A man like Roger
possessed himself more of a woman&rsquo;s mind and
life than the men of to-day that I see around
me seem able to do with their sweethearts.
There was no little corner of her spirit that he
did not wish to occupy, and to gain admission
to her frightened little heart he made himself
small and humble and appealing. Of the sincerity
of his wretchedness and his repentance
there was no doubt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If she were only angry with me,&rdquo; he said
to me, &ldquo;but she&rsquo;s afraid, Roberta. It&rsquo;s a terrible
thing to see her shrink from me. She
doesn&rsquo;t mean to be unkind. She told me in all
seriousness, as if she meant it, that she thought
it would be better for all of us if I left her now.
Why, she&rsquo;s my life, Roberta!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was profoundly touched, as who would not
have been? Nor did I fail to repeat this to Ellen.
I had told Alec what the matter was, for seeing
Ellen listless and remote he had jumped to the
conclusion that Roger had hurt her in some
way, and in Roger&rsquo;s defense I told him the
truth and he put himself stolidly on the side
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>191]</a></span>
of Ellen&rsquo;s instinct. Through one long day she
and Alec went off together as they had when
they were children, while Roger raged up and
down. Ellen wrote:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;We played, as we did when I was little,
&lsquo;Two Years Ago,&rsquo; and for one, beautiful afternoon
I forgot how life can hurt. Just toward
the end Alec cried out to me, &lsquo;Oh, Ellen, why
can&rsquo;t I be older! Why couldn&rsquo;t it have been
I? I&rsquo;d never have hurt you, I&rsquo;d never have
made you afraid of me.&rsquo; And I know that&rsquo;s
true, and I know, too, that poor Alec could
never find a key to the place in me that could
be hurt. There&rsquo;s something wrong with women,
for when once one has felt one&rsquo;s pulse beat
fast, one can never again be content with a
sweet and kind affection. One must wish forevermore
to drown one&rsquo;s self forever and to let
the waters of life sweep over one&rsquo;s head, however
bitter they may be.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>Already, though she didn&rsquo;t know it, she was
coming back to Roger. Every day he went to
see her with some carefully thought-out little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>192]</a></span>
gift. Every night he wrote her a letter which
he sent by me, and she wrote in answer a letter
that she didn&rsquo;t send.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;I suppose [she writes to Roger] that we
can only be cured of the worst hurts of all
by those who have hurt us. Oh, please hide
me from yourself! Oh, protect me! from this
Roger, since I am so afraid of you that my
whole spirit shudders away from you. Shield
me from this, or let me go now while I yet have
strength to leave you, or else make me forget
forever how black life could be if I ever saw
again the face that you turned then on your
mother, and that yet was a part of you.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>There is nothing truer in the life of the affections
than this, that the wound made by those
whom we love can only be cured by them. One
may be sick even to death, and yet the only
cure can come from the one who has poisoned
life for us. There is only one other way to cure
the hurt, and that is to stop loving. That&rsquo;s why
a great many things become easier to bear as
the years go by. We find men and women
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>193]</a></span>
philosophically facing situations which formerly
would have stopped all life for them. These are
the dead of heart who have forgotten to care
when they do this, and where one woman gains
peace from a higher understanding of the man
she loves, a dozen others find it by ceasing to
love at all.</p>

<p>Ellen made her attempt at escape, and then
came back because she couldn&rsquo;t help it. The
one person in the world who could have helped
her was Alec. She was sincere when she told
me:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If Alec was my brother, and had a home
for me somewhere where I need not see Roger
again, I&rsquo;d go to him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was her very docility and lack of resistance
that maddened Roger. He told me:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Somehow Ellen has slipped out of my hands
into a magic circle; she&rsquo;s afraid of me. It&rsquo;s as
though she lived inside a crystal shell&mdash;I can
see her and speak to her, but I can&rsquo;t touch her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I, myself, was very much disturbed and
moved by it all. There was Ellen who had
burned in a fire of happiness, whose very look
at Roger had been a caress, who seemed to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>194]</a></span>
give herself to him by the way she stood,&mdash;her
arms relaxed as though all her body cried
out to him to take her,&mdash;now lost in apathy;
nothing that I told her affected her as far as
I could see. After days of this, just as I was
giving up hope, I met them one afternoon,
swinging down the street toward me, with the
air of a god and goddess recently let out of
prison. Roger had Prudentia flung on his
shoulder, and carried the child aloft as though
she were a flag of triumph. All the explanation
I ever had of the reconciliation was what I had
then and there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He came down the street,&rdquo; Ellen told me,
&ldquo;with Prudentia on his shoulder, and said,
&lsquo;Hello, Ellen,&rsquo; and I said, &lsquo;Hello, Roger,&rsquo; and
he put out his hand to me and I took it. Why,
Roberta, aren&rsquo;t you glad?&rdquo; asked Ellen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She wanted more pomp and circumstance,&rdquo;
Roger jeered at me. &ldquo;She wanted you, Ellen,
to rush to my arms and say, &lsquo;Roderigo, I forgive
thee.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>They went on; I heard their laughter down
the street. That was all the thanks they gave
me.</p>



<p class="padtop"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>195]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>


<p>Ellen wiped the memory of their misunderstanding
completely from her mind. If she
had cared for Roger before, now she burned her
bridges behind her; she swamped herself in her
devotion to him. He stayed in our town until
late fall, and during these months he seemed
to want no other thing than the companionship
of Ellen. The hours that he spent in work
every day were their tragedy. In her journal
Ellen prattled of a time &ldquo;when they should be
married and she could be with him even when
he was working.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The world is full now,&rdquo; she complained,
&ldquo;of closed doors and good-nights and good-byes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>All the diverse and many-sided problems of
marriage resolved themselves, in her simple
mind, into one single meaning, and that was
the continual presence of Roger. She passed
the hours away from him drowned in the
thought of him. Though at that time she wrote
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>196]</a></span>
very little in her journal,&mdash;she was happy,&mdash;she
did write a series of little, good-night letters
that were like so many kisses, fond and extravagant,
the happy babblings of a perfectly
happy heart. Meantime Roger was studying.
It was the first time he had applied himself to
work and found the power of his mind. In the
quiet of this town he got into a tremendous
stride of work and ate up books before him as
fire licks up brushwood. They spent a great
deal of their time together, planning his future
and talking how great a man he was going to
be. He had a gift of natural eloquence and
loved an audience at any time. In that New
England fall, when the crisp air is like wine
and the hills are a miracle of color, Roger
brooded over the picture of his own future,
sketching outlines which he afterwards filled
out. By letter he made friends again with his
father.</p>

<p>Their engagement had been announced and
Ellen was given the consideration which a good
marriage brings one in a little village, a consideration
which she didn&rsquo;t even notice.
Mildred Dilloway, in the mean time, had been&mdash;in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>197]</a></span>
the homely New England phrase&mdash;&ldquo;keeping
company&rdquo; with Edward Graham, and
no one was surprised when it became known
that they were to be married. Ellen writes in
connection with this:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;When I think of what a little fool I was at
that time, I could beat my head against the
door. If I could have but looked ahead a little,
I would have had a little more sense. I needn&rsquo;t
have listened at all to Edward&rsquo;s blitherings and
been saved two years of discomfort. Edward
himself told me about it. &lsquo;Do not think,
Ellen,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;that I&rsquo;m unfaithful to the
thought of you.&rsquo; &lsquo;You couldn&rsquo;t be,&rsquo; said I.
&lsquo;You&rsquo;ll always be poetry to me, remember
that,&rsquo; he told me. &lsquo;I shall try to forget it,&rsquo;
said I. I have never before wished to throw
something at any one as I did then. It was easy
to see that he was a little disappointed in himself
that he could care for any one else after
having made so great a fuss and mourned
around so. I wish he would go away, because
I hate to be forever reminded of the me that
used to be. What if one should turn back into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>198]</a></span>
the person that one was once? I wonder who
the person is that I&rsquo;m going to be. It will be a
happy person or else I shan&rsquo;t be alive; because
if I have Roger I shall be happy, and if anything
happens to him it will happen to me,
too.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>At that moment in her life she could not
imagine any other separation from him than
that caused by some disaster. She hadn&rsquo;t
even faced the necessity of his leaving her when
winter came. She knew he was going away,
but she didn&rsquo;t realize it. They drifted along,
making more of a drama all the time of the
inevitable good-nights and the inevitable separations.
As Ellen wrote: &ldquo;People who are in
love should be endowed; there isn&rsquo;t time for
anything else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>During this little perfect time life held its
breath until Roger went away. The end came
quite suddenly, with a peremptory letter from
his father, who had a chance for him to enter
a very well-known law office, under advantageous
circumstances. While the shadow of separation
was over them, it was like a cloud that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>199]</a></span>
passes near by and only bade the sunshine in
which they stood more bright. She knew Roger
was going, but she didn&rsquo;t really believe it.
She wrote:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;I lived through months of learning to realize
he was gone between the time he left
and dinner. Mr. Sylvester was there, and for
a time I had to put aside the selfishness of my
own grief and I was glad to forget it in talking
of one little thing after another, the way one
does to stifle down the pain of the heart. I
wanted to run after Roger and look at his face
once more. I wanted to run after him and
foolishly throw myself in front of the horse
and say, &lsquo;You can&rsquo;t go.&rsquo; The part of me that
talks was gay, because deeper than anything
else was the wish in me to speed him joyfully
and to have his last memory of me a gay and
triumphant one. Time is a strange thing; all
day it&rsquo;s walked along like a funeral procession,
and before this it has been going so fast that
there has hardly been a chance to get a word
in edgewise between the striking of the hours;
and since Roger went it&rsquo;s taken an eternity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>200]</a></span>
for it to strike the next quarter. I&rsquo;ve tried to
comfort myself by going up to Oscar&rsquo;s Leap,
but my heart was so heavy that I could hardly
walk all of the beautiful, weary way. I don&rsquo;t
like myself for writing like this, for I have him
and he really loves me. The more I see people
and listen to the things they say, the more I
am sure that very few people really love any
one, and those who do love are seldom loved
in return. It must be a terrible thing to love
and feel one&rsquo;s self unloved. Now I&rsquo;m going
to get ready for my mother&rsquo;s wedding and then
get ready for mine, and while my mind tells
me I must be good, my heart cries out, &lsquo;Oh!
Why can&rsquo;t I trade off the useless weeks at the
other end of my life for the weeks that would
mean so much now!&rsquo; As he went away from
me, I felt as though I were never going to see
him again, and, indeed, this Roger and this
Ellen will never see each other again. It seems
to me that before he comes again I shall be
made old by waiting, the days crawl past so
slow and leaden-footed. I&rsquo;ve said good-bye to
this most beautiful time when I&rsquo;ve said good-bye
to Roger.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>201]</a></span>
At first he wrote her very often, but briefly.
She wrote to him, in the intimacy of the letters
she did not intend to send:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;Your dear letters mean, &lsquo;I love you, Ellen;
I think of you; my heart goes out to you.&rsquo;
Once in a while they say, &lsquo;I thirst for you,&rsquo;
but they tell me nothing of all the many things
that I hunger so to know. I&rsquo;d like to be able
to see your life and know what time you wake
up, what time you go to your office, and how
your office looks, and which way it is set toward
the sun so I could imagine you moving
around, and you don&rsquo;t even answer my little, discreet
questions. I would like to know the faces
of all the people you meet often and how you
amuse yourself. I wonder have you lost Ellen
in your big and fearsome city. Roger, I have
times when I&rsquo;m <em>afraid</em>, and I don&rsquo;t know of
what&mdash;just fear, as though the inner heart
of me rang, &lsquo;Something&rsquo;s wrong, something&rsquo;s
wrong, something&rsquo;s wrong,&rsquo; where my mind
has nothing to go on. Roger, I <em>wait</em> for each
one of your letters as if I was afraid it wouldn&rsquo;t
come, and as if it were to be the last. I&rsquo;m
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>202]</a></span>
afraid. I don&rsquo;t trust life as I did, and when I
don&rsquo;t trust life, I can&rsquo;t find you; when I trust
life, it&rsquo;s as if when I shut my eyes I can put
out my hand and touch you. But lately it is
as though I wander around in the dark looking
for you. I tell myself it&rsquo;s foolish, but my heart
won&rsquo;t listen to the voice of reason. It is as
though my confidence had been taken away
from me, as though it had been a gift no one
could touch with hands. My mother&rsquo;s wedding
doesn&rsquo;t mean to me any more her happiness,
but the day that you shall come back
to me and give me back my confidence in life,
and when I look on you again I shall know that
everything is well in the world. I know that
nothing has happened and that nothing can
happen, but my heart knows differently.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>


<p>During the winter Alec came home from
college every Saturday, walking over the
mountain each Saturday afternoon for fifteen
miles, and going back Monday morning by a
stage that started at some unearthly hour,
and carried passengers over to the nearest
town to us through which a railroad ran in
those days.</p>

<p>Various boys of those he had around him
would straggle down the road to meet him, so
when he came into the town on cold winter
nights it was with an escort of red-nosed, red-tippeted
and booted youngsters.</p>

<p>This was before any of the new forms of
education for boys had even so much as stirred
in their sleep, and the town agreed in considering
Alec&rsquo;s friendship with the youngsters a
waste of time on both sides: the parents of the
boys saying that they had something better to
do&mdash;in filling the wood-boxes for instance&mdash;than
to tramp out and get their toes frozen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>204]</a></span>
off to meet Alec. Alec&rsquo;s friends, on the other
hand, wondered what he wanted with a &ldquo;parcel
of young ones.&rdquo; It was only Ellen and
myself who caught a glimpse of just what it
was that Alec was accomplishing, when we
also would walk out to meet him. Besides
supplying them in his own person with a hero
to worship, he drew them out and untangled
their knotty minds for them; for the boy of
ten and twelve was, in my girlhood, even more
misunderstood and kicked about and generally
at odds with life than he is now. Nothing was
done to make his school days happier or the
path of learning easier. Teachers, almost without
exception, were the boys&rsquo; natural enemies.
Almost all the communication boys had from
older people in my day, besides religious instructions,
were recommendations to get to
work and to get to work quickly.</p>

<p>These snowy walks in the crisp air to meet
Alec were the punctuation points of our lives,
and the long, pleasant Saturday evenings that
we spent together, with perhaps some of the
other young people dropping in, were our greatest
pleasure. I am sure Ellen&rsquo;s house seemed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>205]</a></span>
to him the gayest place in the world, because
we concentrated into those few hours on Saturday
evening the gayety of the whole week,
though Ellen did not have much time for
&ldquo;mulling,&rdquo; as her aunt called it. Getting ready
for her mother&rsquo;s marriage meant not only the
preparation of her clothes, but also the preparation
of the whole Scudder house for its occupancy
by Mr. Sylvester and Matilda, Flavilla,
and Prudentia.</p>

<p>Ellen&rsquo;s mood was not at all consistent with
that of vague apprehension, and this warning
note of her spirit she failed to listen to most
of the time; as long as Roger&rsquo;s letters came
regularly, she lived in a shimmering world of
imagination, writing to him all the things she
dared, and then writing to him again all the
things she was too timid to tell him. All the
outward details of her life were constant and
pressing enough, and very homely, most of
them; while within she lived in a shimmering
world of her own, her lovely garden inclosed
of the spirit, into which she let no unkind
breath blow; and so her love for Roger blossomed
throughout the long months of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>206]</a></span>
winter. Then toward Easter came her mother&rsquo;s
wedding, which meant to Ellen Roger&rsquo;s return.
The Resurrection and Roger&rsquo;s return came all
together in Ellen&rsquo;s mind.</p>

<p>When his letter came that told her he couldn&rsquo;t
leave his office at this moment, she could not
at first believe it, any more than she could at
first believe that he had gone away.</p>

<p>Alec was there, and he asked me shortly:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why couldn&rsquo;t Roger come?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s busy,&rdquo; I said.</p>

<p>Alec gave me an odd look.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One can do what one wants to,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>He was one of those over whom Love passes
a maturing hand. At twenty he had lost the
young-robin look of expression, just as he had
lost early the puppy aspect that a boy has before
he has gotten used to man-size hands and
feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to sit back and do
nothing. It&rsquo;s hard when you love any one as
I do Ellen not to be able to get for her any of
the things in life that she wants the most.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What does she want,&rdquo; I asked, &ldquo;that she
hasn&rsquo;t?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>207]</a></span>
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Alec reflected, &ldquo;I can come to see
her every week and Roger can&rsquo;t.&rdquo; He might
have said: &ldquo;I can spend my life on her and give
her every thought of my heart and stand between
her and unhappiness as much as I can,
and Roger can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was one of the few times that Ellen
played make-believe to herself. I think she
had to. It was only later that her straight mind
said what Alec had said, &ldquo;We can do what we
want to.&rdquo; She hid her own disappointment
from herself, and life was good to her in that
it gave her a great deal to do. Although in
those days wedding journeys were very rare,
Mr. Sylvester had an old friend, a minister,
near Washington, who came up to marry them
and they were to exchange pulpits, and so
directly after her disappointment Ellen was
left alone with the three Sylvester children.
Matilda at this time was already eleven and
she remarked gravely to Ellen,&mdash;&ldquo;Ellen,
we&rsquo;ve all decided that you can be our mother.
Of course we shall call your mother &lsquo;Mother,&rsquo;
too, and we shall love her like that, because
we&rsquo;ve made up our minds that it is our <em>duty</em>,&rdquo;&mdash;Matilda
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>208]</a></span>
was very particular about duty,&mdash;&ldquo;but
you&rsquo;ll be our real mother. I&rsquo;ve done the
best I can with the children,&rdquo;&mdash;for thus did
Matilda always refer to her little sisters,&mdash;&ldquo;but
our clothes are in a terrible state since
Mrs. Gillig went away.&rdquo; For the Sylvesters&rsquo;
housekeeper had gone promptly after the announcement
of her employer&rsquo;s engagement.
She had departed to the next town, where her
relatives lived, saying that she was not going
to stay around and be any one&rsquo;s &ldquo;kill-joy&rdquo;;
so with an occasional day&rsquo;s work from Mrs.
Butler and help from Ellen and me, they had
gotten on as best they could.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;I got their poor, little things unpacked
[said Ellen] and got them their supper and
put them to bed and Flavia patted my cheek
and said, &lsquo;Ellen, you&rsquo;re so happy, that&rsquo;s why
we love you,&rsquo; and Prudentia said, &lsquo;Yes, I love
folks that laugh,&rsquo; and it came over me that for
a while, anyway, I really am their mother&mdash;poor
me, who knows so little about doing anything.
Before I went to bed Matilda put her
arm around me and said, &lsquo;Oh! Ellen, I want to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>209]</a></span>
grow up and be capable and take care of father
and mother and everybody, and I&rsquo;ve been
just as capable as I know how ever since Mrs.
Gillig left. I&rsquo;ve been so capable it makes my
jaws ache, and I want to stop and be a little
girl.&rsquo; And pretty soon Aunt Sarah came in to
see how badly I had done everything and to
grumble good-naturedly over my endeavors,
and then Grandma Hathaway dropped in to
see if I needed anything, and they went off
together and left Alec and me alone, and the
children in bed. And Alec never once looked
at me as though he cared for me; he was only
funny and told me stories, just as if he knew
I couldn&rsquo;t have borne affection from any one
but Roger.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>So it was that Ellen hid from herself and
from the pain that was in her heart. This was
one of the few times she played make-believe
with herself. She was afraid of her own doubt
and afraid of her own thoughts, really afraid
for the first time; for this is another of the
painful milestones which most of us have to
pass in the long and bleeding road of love&mdash;the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>210]</a></span>
first time that we are afraid to face our
fears.</p>

<p>Ellen and her mother had been buying cloth
for Ellen&rsquo;s trousseau, and she had put it all by
for her mother to begin on when her mother
should be married. I was to help her, and so,
of course, was Aunt Sarah.</p>

<p>In our days, girls mostly made their own
trousseaux, and the richer among us had some
seamstress engaged for a couple of months or
six weeks, but friends helped one another, and
one was supposed to go to one&rsquo;s husband with
linen enough to last a long time in life, and with
good, substantial garments, suitable for various
occasions in a gentlewoman&rsquo;s life. Ellen had a
poplin and a cashmere among other things, and
when I came a day or two after her mother&rsquo;s
wedding to encourage her to begin on her own
things, I found her on her hands and knees
cutting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Ellen Payne! What&rsquo;s that you&rsquo;re
doing?&rdquo; For instead of cutting out one beautiful
cashmere garment she was cutting three
little frocks. &ldquo;Oh, Miss Grant!&rdquo; I exclaimed,
scandalized, to Miss Sarah, &ldquo;Ellen&rsquo;s cutting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>211]</a></span>
up her blue cashmere from her trousseau for
the children.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Grant adjusted her glasses and peered
down at the patterns on the floor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, there,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;you have Ellen.
We&rsquo;ll have Ellen Payne&rsquo;s trousseau walking all
over town on three pairs of legs, and rather
than patch up their old things, she begins her
new life by taking the very trousseau off her
own back! Some would think you were self-sacrificing,
Ellen, but I know you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Poor Ellen always remained the same, taking
more pleasure in doing any one&rsquo;s work than her
own, and as she told me, &ldquo;the soul of her sickened
in patching up the clothes of those poor
children any more,&rdquo; and, besides, said she:
&ldquo;Everybody else has new clothes, and there&rsquo;s
no one on earth quite so proud as a little girl
with a new frock.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But your own trousseau, Ellen,&rdquo; I objected
scandalized, because I had a proper sentiment
for those things. Ellen was romantic,
but seldom sentimental at all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cloth&rsquo;s cloth,&rdquo; she replied briskly, &ldquo;and
goodness knows when I&rsquo;m to be married and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>212]</a></span>
shall need it, and there&rsquo;s one sure thing, they
need new best dresses right straight away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They needed new best dresses and they
needed new almost everything else, as Matilda
had warned Ellen.</p>

<p>So here was Ellen with her hands full. In
the day before the sewing-machine, when every
stitch had to be put in by hand and there
were no such things as ready-made garments,
making clothes for a family was no light undertaking.
No wonder, then, that we made our
dresses of good stuff, intended to wear; and
Ellen had not only to provide for the little
Sylvesters garments, but for her own trousseau
as well. The young ladies nowadays,
who make themselves a few things and order
and buy ready-made everything else, do not
realize what an undertaking the preparations
for a wedding used to be. It sometimes seems
to me that there was as much difference in our
serious preparation of our clothes and the way
that girls prepare now, as there is in the way
that we prepared ourselves spiritually. Ellen
wrote:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>213]</a></span>
&ldquo;The clothes that I am making mean my
life, Roger. They are not dresses to me any
more. There is one dress I know I shall never
be able to put on without feeling my heart
beat away the minutes slowly while I waited
and waited and waited for your letter. There
are some buttonholes made while it seemed as
if my heart sang like birds. What do you think
I am building with the things I dream of constantly,
as I sit with the thought of you and
sew on the clothes that I shall wear when we
are at last together for always, for thinking is
the way that one builds up or tears down the
things of the spirit? I think I build rather solidly,
and before I can be torn out of this house
of my thoughts of you, I shall have to be pulled
out in little pieces no bigger than your hand.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>She wrote this after she had seen him, for
he came for a two days&rsquo; breathless visit, just
as spring was breaking. He came back the bad,
little boy, ready to sulk if he was scolded for
not coming sooner. This time Ellen had only
sweetness for him, no tears; she was so heart-brokenly
glad to see him, but she wrote:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>214]</a></span>
&ldquo;Where have you gone, Roger, and what&rsquo;s
become of that lovely, shining love that we had?
The horizon has shrunken for us in a curious
way. Where it used to be wider than that of
all the world, and the heavens flung full of stars
and a splendid wind ramping over everything,
our love lives now in a little world full of small
hopes and fears, a dwarfed place. I suppose all
this means that I wanted to ask you when you
were here, &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, Roger? What
has happened to your love for me?&rsquo; And I
didn&rsquo;t dare to because I knew that you would
say, &lsquo;Nothing.&rsquo; I know you would look at me
as one who says, &lsquo;Am I not here with you now?
Don&rsquo;t be a tiresome woman.&rsquo; When I said to
you&mdash;and I said it half smiling&mdash;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s a terrible
thing how a man can eat up a woman&rsquo;s life
as you do mine, so I am all yours,&rsquo; you turned
away as though you didn&rsquo;t hear me. You
made acknowledgment of a word that was
only half kind. I write this to you which I
would never say to you because if said to you
it would be a reproach. I write to you since
I have need of my soul talking to yours, and
with no reproach in my mind, but to try and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>215]</a></span>
understand what it is that has happened. Before,
had I shown you my heart that way,
you would have caught me to you. Must I be
careful not to give you too much of myself,
Roger; must I pour myself out to you in small
sips,&mdash;you who wished to drink of me, as
though your thirst for me would never become
quenched? It seemed to me that there
were as many things to keep silent about while
you were here as before we had things to talk
about. We were always running into ghosts of
the way we used to care, and yet you were so
dear to me and sweet to me.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>Lovers forever have watched the affections
ebb out bit by bit, and have been as powerless
to stop the ebbing as the tides of the sea. This
causeless change, this heart-breaking wintertime
of the affections, is one of the hardest
things of all to bear. When people quarrel they
can &ldquo;make up&rdquo; again, but this slow alteration
from life to death comes as relentlessly as age
and seems as little in our power to change as
age&rsquo;s coming. It has been the anguish of lovers
from all time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>216]</a></span>
All through the coming of spring and summer,
Ellen had brooded over this change, wondering
if it was her fault, measuring Roger&rsquo;s affection
and cherishing every little phrase of love which
he put in his letters, every desire to see her,
and magnifying them, and stitching all the
while her doubts and hopes&mdash;hopes a little
frayed and tarnished&mdash;into her wedding-clothes.
There was a time when he promised
every week to come, and every week there
came a letter instead of Roger. He played
fast and loose with her as it suited him, now
coming to see her a splendid young prince, now
leaving her without word for weeks.</p>

<p>It is an awful and bleeding thing when a
woman realizes that the beloved has changed
toward her and she doesn&rsquo;t know the reason,
and it is still harder to have given more of
one&rsquo;s self than has been wanted, and this Ellen
did continually. Suffering herself, she wanted
to spare Roger suffering.</p>

<p>So she lived along in that hope deferred that
maketh the heart sick. Then all word of Roger
ceased for a time. She wrote to him as she had
always and then she wrote him a letter that
she never sent, releasing him.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>217]</a></span>
&ldquo;Once, when I was a little girl, I thought I
was engaged because I thought I was in love,
and I spent two years of my life in thinking
that my life was dear to this man. I lived in a
torment of doubt of what to do rather than
hurt him. I could not bear to have any one
live this way for me, and least of all you who
have been the heart of life to me, and so before
this happens to you let us say good-bye to
each other as splendidly and gayly as we first
met each other. Love does not come at any
one&rsquo;s bidding, nor will it stay, and I would
blame no one in this world for ceasing to love,
least of all the one whom I love. But I could
not endure from you a cowardly drifting away
from me, I could not bear to see you fear to
face bravely a moment of pain, nor could I
bear the dishonorable shiftiness with which
some men loosen the bonds between themselves
and the women whom they have loved.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>And under this page, which was written on
good notepaper,&mdash;a true never-sent letter,&mdash;she
had written: &ldquo;<em>Oh! if I had the courage to
send this now!</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>218]</a></span>
Then came Roger, triumphant and upstanding,
his first pleaded case in his pocket, a
splendid young prince again, as prodigal with
apologies as he was with love. The miracle happened;
they turned back the hands of time for a few
days.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;He held me from him, the way he does,
at arm&rsquo;s length, and said: &lsquo;Ellen, have you
doubted me?&rsquo; What could I say to him? When
I had courage enough to say, &lsquo;What&rsquo;s been
the matter, Roger? Where did you go so I
couldn&rsquo;t find you?&rsquo; he only laughed and said,
&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve been in the devil&rsquo;s own temper.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>This was the last time she fought against
him. From this time on he loosed his careless
hand and tightened the clutch of it over her
heart until it bled, according to his mood.
When she didn&rsquo;t write him for a while he
rushed to her, to see that his own was his own,
and this was as much as any woman ought to
have asked, so he felt. She wrote:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s one thing I&rsquo;ve learned about you,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>219]</a></span>
Roger, when first I saw the other Roger, and
that was if any one denied you anything, you
loved to beg for it. As long as a thing denies
itself to you, you must strive for it, and knowing
this of you, it is a weapon that I can never
use. If I played you as if you were a trout in
the stream, played you until I reeled you in
to me, tired and gasping, I might have held
you in my hand always. Whatever I shall do
for you in life, I shall never do anything that
shows my love for you more, in that I won&rsquo;t
traffic with your love, and keep it for myself
by playing a game with you. I make you this
present, a real gift, as my aunt once said, and
one that you won&rsquo;t know about ever.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>So she wrote in the deep bitterness of her
heart.</p>


<p class="break">The wedding had been fixed for October and
all the time there was one little song that sung
itself to her: &ldquo;When we&rsquo;re married, then I can
show him how I really care; when I&rsquo;m with him,
nothing will be hard for me, for it is suspense
that kills.&rdquo; For she trusted him as women
must, in the face of disloyalty and carelessness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>220]</a></span>
In the early fall, after a season of silence,
when she was too sick at heart even to write,
he came. He had a deprecatory air. He came
as one asking the favor of something which he
ought not to have, and it was characteristic of
him, with his intolerance of the disagreeable,
that he should break the edge of telling Ellen,
so to speak, by telling me first.</p>

<p>He had come to defer the wedding, and his
reason for wishing to do so we found out later.
I remember how he sat in my kitchen, his
heavy, handsome profile silhouetted against
the flaming, evening sky, his head swung forward.
He lifted his face toward me with a
sharp, impatient gesture, looked at me, and
asked a question, to me inconceivable.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think she is going to make an awful
fuss?&rdquo;</p>



<p class="padtop"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>221]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>


<p>Here my long-cherished resentment toward
Roger overflowed. No one could have been
with Ellen as I had been without seeing the
turmoil in which her spirit lived. She had
grown thin and of a certain transparency as do
those whose sufferings of the spirit affect their
bodies profoundly. I knew there were long
times when he didn&rsquo;t write; I knew how she
waited for his letters; I knew how seldom he
came. I felt, in my wisdom, that she bore
from Roger things I would stand from no man.
I had learned, step by step with Ellen, that
Ellen&rsquo;s life and all her happiness were in careless
hands and, in Alec&rsquo;s language, that there
was no country of the heart there for her. I
looked at Roger with level-eyed disgust.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Roger,&rdquo; I asked him, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you
break your engagement now, if that&rsquo;s what
you mean to do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>To my point-blank question, he only stared
at me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>222]</a></span>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to break it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Ellen&rsquo;s
just exactly the kind of a woman I want for
my wife,&rdquo; he added.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But in your good time,&rdquo; said I bitterly.</p>

<p>He looked at me with his bold, laughing eyes:</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a delight of life with Ellen that
I can find with no one else. I know what she
is, Roberta, a thousand times more than you.
She&rsquo;s the only <em>alive</em> person in the world, but
since you put the words in my mouth, &lsquo;In my
own good time!&rsquo;&rdquo; He had completely recovered
his good-tempered arrogance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d never stand from you what Ellen&rsquo;s
stood, and I hope she says good-bye to you
now,&rdquo; I cried.</p>

<p>It is easy for those not in love to place the
limit to love&rsquo;s endurance. It is fortunately not
easy to keep these shallow promises to one&rsquo;s
self.</p>

<p>I am sorry that so much of what was most
unlovely in Roger creeps into my story. At
the time I had no patience with him, his undeniable
charm and interest offended me as it
kept Ellen bound to him. I wanted, as youth
always does, people to be all bad or all good,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>223]</a></span>
and Roger would be neither of these things.
I realize now that, faithful or unfaithful, he
kept Ellen&rsquo;s life full of him, nor could she escape
his compelling personality. There are many
men we should not quarrel with,&mdash;men who
can so absorb us, like him of the ultra-masculine
type, who have everything but pity and
understanding of what they themselves haven&rsquo;t
felt. They are of all men the most attractive
to women and they care the least about the
individual. From now on she loved him always
with a fear that he was waiting for her with a
knife for her back. She wrote:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;Oh, how much make-believe we have had!
I&rsquo;ve pretended that I thought it was nice for
Roger to work, and he&rsquo;s pretended to me that
he wanted to work, but he doesn&rsquo;t want me&mdash;that&rsquo;s
the real reason. When I wake in the
morning, I feel my heart crying within me in
the deep heaviness of my spirit before I can
remember what&rsquo;s happened, and then I remember
that Roger doesn&rsquo;t want me. He
doesn&rsquo;t want me and I can&rsquo;t imagine life
going on without him. I&rsquo;ve always thought to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>224]</a></span>
feel unbeloved would be the worst thing that
could happen to me. I don&rsquo;t know myself in
this beggared person. Life seems so empty for
me, and I go shivering up to Alec to warm my
cold spirit at the fire of his affection. I look
back at the time when I waited for Roger to
come back to me, just three little days, and the
touch of his hand still warm in mine, and think
how happy I was then.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>A little later she became more accustomed
to the idea and wrote:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;Roger, I&rsquo;m ashamed of how I felt, and I&rsquo;m
glad of one thing, that you know nothing about
it. Have you seen me as I am, and is that why
you no longer care as you did? I&rsquo;ve been a
cowardly, shivering thing, afraid of your letters
even, afraid of what would come next. How
can a man love so cowardly a woman? Why
should I count and measure love for love, instead
of rejoicing with you in your work? It
is I that know nothing about love, since I can
whine and since I can compare and contrast
yesterday with to-day, instead of being glad
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>225]</a></span>
that you are alive and in the same world with
me; and why should I care if, since you want
to marry me, you have lost some of the first
hot flame, a flame which burned us both? Are
all women in life egotists that they can&rsquo;t bear
that the eyes of the beloved don&rsquo;t rest on them
every moment?&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>There was very little use in her trying to
hearten herself with brave words, for women
know when a part of the life of the man they
love belongs to them and when it doesn&rsquo;t.
Many of us live for years separated from the
man we love, and know that his thoughts turn
to us continually, that time and space are a
terrible, practical joke played by destiny on
mankind. There had been a moment in Ellen&rsquo;s
life when, whether he were thinking of her or
not, there was no place in his life where she
might not go, and now the foundation of a real
affection was lacking between them, and that
foundation is sincerity. In whatever way she
tried to go to him she came upon high walls
and barriers of silence, places in his spirit
marked &ldquo;No thoroughfare.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>226]</a></span>
&ldquo;I know nothing about you, Roger; [she
writes] I only know that things are going on
that are hostile to me and to our love. I suppose,
that you do not tell me what it is shows
you do not trust me and that I&rsquo;ve grasped too
much and asked too much. I fight forever with
an unseen adversary. I don&rsquo;t even know if
this adversary has a face or if it is a set of
circumstances in your life, and I have nothing
to fight with but my bleeding love for you, and
what good is that to you unless you happen to
want it? What thing is so worthless as an
undesired love? Yet you made it, Roger, and
you are responsible for it. It is like having a
child and then finding it troublesome, letting it
starve to death, to create a love like mine for
you and then kill it. Women who love should
never doubt. They should trust and trust in
the face of dishonor and in the face of disaster,
for distrust carries with it a bitter strength.
A woman who trusts utterly is a woman who
gives herself utterly, and then, when the blow
descends from the blue, it also crushes her
utterly, perhaps it may even kill her, but she
has had that exalted peace even until the last
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>227]</a></span>
moment. It&rsquo;s all the difference between having
one&rsquo;s beloved brought home dead, who went
out smiling, and having him die horribly inch
by inch, before one&rsquo;s eyes. It is better to have
love killed than to have it tortured to death,
and I would rather have had you say, in the
midst of our deepest hour together, &lsquo;Ellen,
I&rsquo;m going away and I shall never see you
again,&rsquo; than wait as I do for you to tell me it&rsquo;s
finished.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>This was how Ellen&rsquo;s spirit lived, racked and
torn between its grave fears and its momentary
and joyful hopes, while the day was passed
in a thousand details of a house humming with
children. As Ellen said herself, &ldquo;The outer side
of her life was living in sunshine and the inner
side in darkness and doubt.&rdquo; In town people
said Ellen was working too hard over Mr.
Sylvester&rsquo;s brood, for she seemed at that time
so frail that through the transparent shell of
her one could see her spirit burning.</p>

<p>None of the family suspected that there was
any misunderstanding between them, for Roger
had a very kindly generosity. He was a man
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>228]</a></span>
prodigal in the small acts of kindness, and was
forever sending things for the children and for
Mrs. Sylvester, whom he treated like an elder
sister, teasing her and loving her. Miss Grant
was the only one who had had occasional misgivings,
and I learned from my grandmother
that Roger&rsquo;s family were not satisfied with his
&ldquo;goings on,&rdquo; and that while he was being a
success, his mother was worried over him,
which made my grandmother remark:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish that young man had fallen from
his horse and broken his neck before ever he
set eyes on Ellen Payne. Old women like us
forget that young creatures die of a broken
heart now and again, and if they could only
die! The best friend I ever had, Roberta, had
all the youth and love killed in her and went
on living like a dry, little automaton of a
woman, and is living yet. Instead of the things
she might have had,&mdash;children and a husband
and a home,&mdash;she has just her own dried-up
body, which is like a little birch tree struck
by lightning; and the thing she thinks of most
in life is the noise that the sparrows make in
her elm trees.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>229]</a></span>
But I could not fear that a fate like that
awaited my Ellen, for my memory of her then
is a lovely frail thing, with a hand forever held
out to Prudentia and Flavilla.</p>

<p>Prudentia when crossed stopped, as was her
custom, to pray. She prayed in season and out
of season and for everything, and it was against
her father&rsquo;s principles to stop her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How stop a child communing with her
Maker?&rdquo; he would argue, to which Ellen
would reply with spirit:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s only communing with her own selfishness
when she says: &lsquo;Oh! God, send the boys
home so Ellen can tell me a story.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>For several of Alec&rsquo;s youngsters hung around
the old Scudder place a great deal, and accompanied
Ellen on her walks, as though Alec
had left her, in those boys, a bit of his protecting
spirit.</p>



<p class="padtop"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>230]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>


<p>Various important things happened that
winter. The first was a deep surprise to all
of Alec&rsquo;s friends. He became engaged to his
landlady&rsquo;s daughter in the town where he went
to college.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How can you?&rdquo; I asked him, &ldquo;caring for
Ellen?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you see,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s all over,
isn&rsquo;t it, forever? No matter what happens,
Ellen is Roger&rsquo;s, and why should I hang around
and bay the moon? Elizabeth knows all about
Ellen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how you can,&rdquo; I repeated.</p>

<p>And then he said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Roberta, it seems a wonderful thing to me
that any one should care for me. How can I
hurt a love that has been given to me? I care
for her in a different way from Ellen and there
is all truth between us.&rdquo; Then he laughed.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a funny thing; Roger loves no one, Ellen
loves Roger, I love Ellen, and Elizabeth cares
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>231]</a></span>
for me. By doing this I&rsquo;m making the tangle
less.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That is all he would tell me at the time, but,
being romantic then and still romantic, I have
always thought that his chivalry and compassion
had been skillfully played upon.</p>

<p>With a touching belief in the generosity of
woman that is possible only in extreme youth,
Alec effected a meeting between Elizabeth and
Ellen at which I was present. All three of us
were painfully polite and well behaved. Our
cordiality was touching as we played to our
dear Alec as audience. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Ellen to
me afterwards, &ldquo;isn&rsquo;t it dreadful! why couldn&rsquo;t
he have chosen any one else! She&rsquo;s sweet, of
course; but think, Roberta, of that doll-faced
thing as Alec&rsquo;s wife.&rdquo; While Elizabeth is reported
to have said that on beholding Ellen
she could hardly keep herself from exclaiming
aloud, &ldquo;Why, is <em>that</em> Ellen Payne!&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was in midwinter that Mrs. Byington
asked Ellen to visit her. She had often asked
Ellen before, but there had been various reasons;
Roger always preferred to spend the time
with Ellen in the country. It seemed to me
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>232]</a></span>
that in the days of her preparation it was like
seeing a person come back to life. She has
written:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been so homesick for you, Roger, that
I felt like those people who die of homesickness
in a far-off country. I feel as though I had been
put away in a place where there was no air to
breathe, and now I am to be let out into the
sunlight once more, since you want me to come
to you.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>Roger came back with her, but during the
week she was away there was no entry at all.
The visit was a time of confusion and excitement.
Mrs. Byington gave her three beautiful
frocks, more beautiful than anything she
had ever seen, and it seemed to Ellen that she
had met the whole city of Boston, and that
she had been drowned in compliments. They
seemed to her to have only just learned of her
engagement, and she felt the weight of their
curious eyes upon her, and realized that they
turned from compliments to gossip, and Mrs.
Byington, in the mean time, scarcely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>233]</a></span>
concealed her relief at Ellen&rsquo;s presence and her
pleasure at the impression Ellen had made.
Miss Sarah told these things to my grandmother,
having accompanied Ellen.</p>

<p>Ellen made one friend, a girl younger than
herself, a cousin of Roger&rsquo;s, who unconsciously
played a part, since she put in Ellen&rsquo;s hands
the answer to so many riddles, the uncertainties
that so tortured her.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;Now I know all the things that tortured
me so,&rdquo; she wrote. &ldquo;I felt that I was in Boston
for some definite purpose that I didn&rsquo;t know
about, and the reason Katherine showed me,
as though she had flung out a careless hand and
pulled back a curtain, and I felt as though I
had listened at Roger&rsquo;s door. &lsquo;Aunt Lydia
was glad enough to have you come,&rsquo; said she.
&lsquo;Of course, we in the family have known of
Roger&rsquo;s engagement, even if he hasn&rsquo;t talked
about it outside, but since his quarrel with
Mary Leckie, he&rsquo;s been eager enough too.&rsquo;
And her little careless words gave me a picture
of all the things I didn&rsquo;t know, but that I had
felt, and as if to make it sure it seemed that
Mrs. Byington apologized to me when she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>234]</a></span>
said: &lsquo;Roger is making great strides at his profession;
it is a compensation for many things
to know that the man one loves is a man of
great attainment.&rsquo; It is as though my heart
had been dried up suddenly. I look back at
the time when I could cry as a time of happiness.
If he should love some one more than me,
how could I blame him, but he has used me as
a pawn in the game, to hurt some one he&rsquo;s
been unkind to, perhaps some one who loved
him, too. What attainment of his can wipe out
this cruelty? I saw the little look of triumph
on his face when he saw his friends approved
of me. Now what hope have I or where can I
turn in this world? I have just one good little
word to cling to&mdash;he said to me wistfully,
&lsquo;Oh! Ellen, why wouldn&rsquo;t you run away with
me?&rsquo; They say love is blind, but no man knows
or excuses a man so little as the woman who
loves him.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>She had not seen him alone when she wrote
this, as Miss Grant accompanied them home.
It was on Saturday afternoon, and they went
walking on the road to meet Alec, that Ellen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>235]</a></span>
learned her own heart. Roger was in a dangerous
mood, kind on the surface, but underneath
a mood that said: &ldquo;Take me or leave me; I am
as I am.&rdquo; Perhaps he regretted burning his
bridges behind him; perhaps he chafed at the
restraint of the inevitable marriage. For once
he was ready to draw the hidden things to the
surface. Ellen wrote:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;I know now who I am, and I know that I
have no pride in the world and that there&rsquo;s no
place where I stop in my love for Roger; no
matter what he does to me, I cannot leave him;
no matter what happens, I ask only to be with
him. We started out across the mountain. It
was slushy underfoot and the cold, damp air
whining up from the river. All the world looked
sullen, and a sad little moon peered through
a hole in the clouds. I felt inside as sad and
cold as the world seemed. Roger walked along,
his head thrown forward, looking into the dusk
the way he looked at his mother. At last he
said: &lsquo;Did you have a good time in Boston,
Ellen?&rsquo; And I knew he was questioning me
as to what I had seen, throwing the door open
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>236]</a></span>
on everything; and I had gone out with him,
meaning to tell him what I thought and stand
and fall by that. I said to myself a hundred
times to-day, &lsquo;There are better things in this
world than happiness,&rsquo; but at his menacing
voice I could say nothing. I looked down into
the abyss of my need of him and there was no
bottom to it. I felt that at a word from me he
would quarrel with me, perhaps fling me away
from him, and I didn&rsquo;t dare say anything.
After a long silence he said: &lsquo;You look dispirited,
Ellen; you&rsquo;re never happy, are you, unless
some one is telling you that you&rsquo;re the Rose
of the World?&rsquo; Tears burned behind my eyes,
but I turned his challenge into a joke. In that
moment I had seen what life would mean without
him, and I saw it wouldn&rsquo;t be life, that I am
his at his own price&mdash;no matter what I must
do, no matter what I must suffer, if he gives me
faith or unfaith. I thought I had pride, but I
know now that I ask for nothing but to stay
near him at his own terms. I know there is
nothing I would not do to keep him by my side,
that the only thing intolerable to me is that
he should leave me. There&rsquo;s no little pride or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>237]</a></span>
self-respect left for me to wrap myself in any
more. I walked beside him fighting back the
tears, and it was like a deliverance to me when
Alec came striding toward me, his head up, and
his hair blowing in the wind, and I could blot
out myself for a minute. When we got home,
the three children were in the cold hall.
Matilda and Flavilla were trying to make
Prudentia come in, and Prudentia was praying,
as she had been for half an hour, that I would
come home. My little mother met me very
shame-faced and said, &lsquo;Dearest, see what I&rsquo;ve
found,&rsquo; and it was an enormous bag of holey
stockings that she had put away to mend as
a surprise for me, and had forgotten, and all the
little details of life wrapped around me sweetly,
but it&rsquo;s hard to have every one good to me
but the one whom I love.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>Love has its base places and its hideous
slaveries of the spirit, but yet there is a certain
comfort in utter abandonment. Ellen was
like a man who has feared bankruptcy and who
breathes again when he has at last actually
failed; she had nothing to lose any more in her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>238]</a></span>
own spirit. She might lose Roger, but no other
thing, for she now asked for nothing for herself.
She had reached the lowest grade where
one&rsquo;s soul may live, when she knows there is
nothing that one wouldn&rsquo;t suffer at the hands
of the beloved. Pride comes first&mdash;a blessed
relief&mdash;between most women and such pain;
but many women know something of the shame
akin to it when they sacrifice their sincerity
and their sense of truth rather than run the
risk of a frown from the man they love.</p>

<p>The whole event had been one of unspeakable
defeat and horror to Ellen; all that was
fair and sweet in life to her turned black. There
was no explaining away or excusing what Roger
had done; she was too fair-minded to try. She
saw the act in all its smallness, but it didn&rsquo;t
affect her want of him. During the next dark
months she had all the pain of one who has
been utterly abandoned by her lover, and she
suffered, too, from jealousy and was ashamed
of her suffering. Because she had told herself
the truth about herself always, she had not
even the disillusion that she was playing a fine
and noble part. She only knew that it was no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>239]</a></span>
virtue of hers, but just a necessity for her to
continue to spend herself endlessly for Roger.
Her body, too, suffered pitifully, and she
seemed to me to do nothing but wait for the
meager words that Roger sent her.</p>

<p>Then happened in her heart that which I
now know is the climax of the whole story. I
knew nothing of it except that I knew that at
a certain time Ellen grew happier.</p>

<p>She stopped waiting and became again
master of her own soul, and the light of her
spirit shone high again. She told me nothing,
for things like this one cannot tell to another
person. How can we tell another person of the
rebirth of one&rsquo;s own soul?</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how to tell what has happened
to me, [wrote Ellen,] but I know that
I have come to the other side of suffering. I
know it is as though I had been sitting at the
bottom of a dark well, and suddenly, in the
blackness of the sky above me, I saw a star
and climbed out toward it. I know I shall lose
this vision and go stumbling on, but sometimes
it will come back to me; and I shall always have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>240]</a></span>
the memory of it and never again can I be
in the muddy darkness in which my spirit has
lived. I sat awake all night thinking of Roger
in a flooding tenderness of love and understanding,
and I realized that in all this time
I&rsquo;ve only just been learning the first painful
paths on the road of love. Whatever one gives
sorrowfully isn&rsquo;t love, nor does love fear; it
asks only to understand more and more. As
long as one has fear, one thinks of one&rsquo;s self;
as long as one is sad, one thinks of one&rsquo;s self.
Until one has learned not to say, &lsquo;Give, give,&rsquo;
one doesn&rsquo;t know the meaning of love. So
many sins are committed in the name of love
continually and I will commit no more. &lsquo;I love
you&rsquo; has been a reason even for killing the ones
whom we love, but for this one night I have had
a vision of something that transcends love of
self. Let me give and let me understand. Love
must be either an equal exchange between
equals or else a complete giving by one person,
so let my giving be complete.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>So it was that from a woman ashamed of
her own abasement, Ellen walked forth with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>241]</a></span>
head up, meeting the difficulties that life put
to her and turning them into sweetness. Roger
felt this change in her. Lately all intercourse
between them had been, on Ellen&rsquo;s side, a silent
questioning, and on his side, silent anger at her
questioning; and the whole situation scarcely
less strained than had they talked to each other.
After having gone through the painful Calvary
of love, the pain of waiting and the pain of
doubt, and of trust misplaced and of jealousy,
she had come through to the other side of grief.</p>

<p>Her high mood had made her see life so truly
that an event which shocked the rest of us did
not touch her, since she saw it in its true relation
to Roger&rsquo;s life, even though it again put
off her wedding, violently and cataclysmally.</p>

<p>He came during the winter occasionally,
looking rather haggard and gaunt and ill at
ease with life, and he rested himself more and
more on her breast as if trying further and
further and with deeper confidence this unspeakable
affection of hers.</p>

<p>Miss Sarah brought the news to our house,
and she was agitated as I never have seen her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may as well stay, Roberta,&rdquo; she said,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>242]</a></span>
&ldquo;because, after all, it may be better that you
shall tell Ellen. No,&rdquo; she contradicted herself,
&ldquo;no one shall carry my burdens for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s happened to Roger?&rdquo; my grandmother
asked; and I sat silent and trembling,
pictures of a dead Roger in my mind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Roger&rsquo;s father has turned him off; he&rsquo;s
been mixed up in some disgraceful gambling
scrape. He&rsquo;s been very wild this winter, poor
Lydia writes me,&mdash;poor heart-broken woman.
He escaped actual arrest only through his
father&rsquo;s influence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Little by little the whole series of events
were made clear before my horrified young eyes.
Country New England in those days was a
place of rigid morals, nor were young girls
taught to condone the frailties of men, and
gambling at that time had a guilty and glittering
sound. All our feelings, I think, were,
how fortunate it should have occurred before
Ellen&rsquo;s wedding. When Miss Sarah told her,
she said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know, he&rsquo;s written me already,&rdquo; but she
didn&rsquo;t add, &ldquo;And I&rsquo;ve written him to come to
me.&rdquo; She wrote:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>243]</a></span>
&ldquo;When I got his letter telling me what had
happened and releasing me, it seemed to me as
if all the smouldering love in me for him burst
into flame, and now, in the moment when
every one&rsquo;s turned on him, I am triumphantly
and gladly his more than ever I&rsquo;ve been. I feel
as if I could stretch out my arms to him in the
darkness and shield him from all harm and
trouble. I feel as if I had been talking with
him face to face, and that all this had burned
away all those things that have been between us
all this time. And he turned to me at this time
with &lsquo;I suppose you, too, Ellen, will want no
more of me, but I wish, Ellen, I could say good-bye
to you myself instead of writing it&mdash;you&rsquo;ve
been so true, Ellen.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>So in the spring, two years after she first met
Roger, Ellen went to Oscar&rsquo;s Leap to await his
coming. She loved the gallant bearing of him,
for he came no broken penitent. He was no
coward before the challenge of life; he loved
the difficult and had a lovely joy in such battles.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They kicked me out, Ellen,&rdquo; he told her,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>244]</a></span>
&ldquo;and I&rsquo;ve kicked them all out. Now it&rsquo;s me
with my own two hands and my own two feet
and you in the world. Why didn&rsquo;t you tell
me to do this before?&rdquo; He loved the feeling he
had of foot-looseness. He needed just one person
to hold a hand out to him in the general
wreckage of life, and his own woman had done
this for him. When he got her letter, it seemed
to him as though he had fallen to the earth
only to spring up strong again.</p>

<p>This time Ellen&rsquo;s whole family was against
her, even to Mr. Sylvester, whose gentle nature
always distrusted Roger. He had feared
him from the first, having that gift of judgment
of character that gentle and simple people
often have. Ellen writes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;We had a fine scene, like that in a novel,
at our house. Mr. Sylvester forbade Roger the
house, and I flung myself in Roger&rsquo;s arms and
said that I would never leave him. Mother
cried, and I could hear the children breathing
at the keyhole and Prudentia praying in the
hall. I suppose I should take it more seriously.
I am sorry to be at odds with them, but what
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>245]</a></span>
difference does it make to me, after all? I am
glad just that Roger is back. If I could go with
him now out into the world, I would put my
hand in his and go, but the last thing he needs
at this moment is a wife, and the first thing of
all he needs is me. Now all my days of waiting
have been paid for, now all my nights of doubt.
If after this he should turn from me and love
me no more, I should have had this and it
would have paid for everything in my life. I
can&rsquo;t take Mr. Sylvester&rsquo;s and my mother&rsquo;s
attitude seriously, because I know, as if I could
read the future, that Roger will go out in the
world and come back and be forgiven. I am
wrong to be almost glad that it has happened,
but it has made it possible for me to show him
my heart, my poor bleeding heart, that has
been silent for so long.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>Roger found work in a neighboring village
and they met at the house of Ellen&rsquo;s old friend,
the peddler, or he took Ellen with him. During
this time Roger flung from him again all of his
life. He was one whom the confessional would
have served well, for he could purge himself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>246]</a></span>
from all blame by telling everything and by
passing to the innocent the burden of all his
weaknesses. Now that life made some demand
on him, the best of him shone out.</p>

<p>There was, to be sure, the making of a fine
family scandal when it was discovered that
Ellen was meeting Roger, but Ellen refused to
quarrel; she refused to defend herself or do anything
but laugh; and when I, rather scandalized
at the lightness with which she took this whole
situation, pointed out that her aunt was sulking
and that her mother and Mr. Sylvester
were sad, she replied with levity: &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll get
over it.&rdquo; During the long winter of silence and
of forging her spirit into this flaming thing it
now was, she had learned that lesson which
is so difficult for youth, and that is that all
things pass and that to-morrow brings peace
to the bruised heart.</p>

<p>Her prophecy concerning Roger came to
pass. After the weeks spent with her he went
West, made friends with a friend of his father,&mdash;who
had a lighter attitude toward Roger&rsquo;s
frailties, having had no opportunity to be tired
out by them,&mdash;did well in pleading some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>247]</a></span>
spectacular cases, and came back, not the
prodigal son, but triumphantly and gladly;
then after his year of self-denial he plunged
deeply into all sorts of amusements.</p>



<p class="padtop"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>248]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>


<p>Ellen, during his absence, had kept closer
and closer to her high mood. She knew that
certain sorts of happiness were not for her with
Roger, and that certain things he did and his
moments of neglect and forgetfulness no longer
wounded her to death. A month before her
marriage she went to Boston again to buy her
best things. Mrs. Sylvester had had a small
legacy left her, and insisted that it must go to
Ellen&rsquo;s trousseau. I accompanied Mrs. Sylvester
and Ellen. Roger was frankly relieved in
his mind to have Ellen in Boston and the day
of his wedding at last in sight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There was never a man,&rdquo; he told me,
&ldquo;looked forward to his wedding with greater
eagerness. I&rsquo;m through with philandering,
Roberta. No one knows more than I what
Ellen has stood for my sake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I knew he was referring to a mild flirtation
gossip concerning him which had come to
Ellen and to me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>249]</a></span>
It seemed as if now nothing could come in
their way and as if all was clear before them.
Almost every detail was provided for when
Ellen&rsquo;s prayer that she had prayed day by
day and day by day&mdash;&ldquo;Give me understanding
and insight&rdquo;&mdash;received its supreme answer.</p>

<p>It was Roger&rsquo;s temperament, and Ellen understood
this, to fill the vacant places in his
life with small love-affairs. At first she had
suffered a certain jealousy and afterwards
humiliation, and then dismissed it all as negligible,
never thinking of it, as was natural, from
the other woman&rsquo;s point of view. This last
vague affair had been with a young girl visiting
from the South, who hadn&rsquo;t known Roger was
engaged, as he supposed she had. I noticed
in the different places where we went a little,
frail figure with a pretty, strained face, with
eyes continually and irritatingly on Roger.
His mother had said of him, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not one
who kisses and tells, but one who kisses and
runs&rdquo;; and he was avoiding her with his instinctive
avoidance of the disagreeable. She
was a foolish, suffering girl, like Ellen without
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>250]</a></span>
pride, and even lacking the guard of Ellen&rsquo;s
reserve, haunting what she had thought had
been her love for the balm of a single word
which, though she had lost him, would make
his memory sweet to her.</p>

<p>We were at a great party given by one of
Roger&rsquo;s relatives, in Ellen&rsquo;s honor, two dazzled,
little country Cinderellas, and for a moment
had drawn ourselves apart to a recess of the
big hall, and we saw Roger looking for us. The
young girl hurrying across ran almost into his
arms, and as they stood she cried out, in a little
flowing voice, &ldquo;Roger.&rdquo; His face went white
with anger and set itself into the lines that
since then have been known as &ldquo;his sentencing
face.&rdquo; He didn&rsquo;t speak, but looked at her with
quiet, cruel, and scornful eyes. There was silence
between them, and she tortured the long
white gloves that she held in her nervous hands,
looking so frail that a breath might have blown
her away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been trying to speak to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think we said all that was necessary before,&rdquo;
he told her with the same cold, white
scorn. He had been stopped in his search for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>251]</a></span>
what he wanted, and here was being made a
scene that he had tried to avoid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been trying not to speak to you,&rdquo; he
said very quietly, &ldquo;because I had nothing to
say to you that could please you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then tormented out of herself, she cried out:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Roger, was there no reality of any friendship
between us? Were you engaged all the
time that I&rsquo;ve known you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s been nothing between us. What
should there be? Just a moonshine of words,&rdquo;
he answered her. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been engaged three
years. Do you wish anything else?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She didn&rsquo;t answer, but went away, a lonely,
little, fragile figure, shivering as though struck
with a great cold. He had had no moment of
compassion; his instinct had been to crush her
with as little pity as he would an annoying fly.
In his ruthlessness he took even the past from
her, not even leaving her the shadow of her
romance for comfort. Ellen and I had both
seen her wilt before him and the light in her
eyes go out, and I felt Ellen&rsquo;s hand shaking in
mine as the girl had shivered, and she whispered
in my ear:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>252]</a></span>
&ldquo;There, but for the grace of God, goes Ellen
Payne.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here was her prayer granted and understanding
was given her. The final tragedy is
not to be unloved, but to find out that one has
loved nothing;&mdash;that within the shell of the
body there is nothing to which we can give
ourselves;&mdash;to have been cursed with the love
of the shallow-hearted; and there is a deep
torment, beyond the loss of death, which goes
with the unknitting of two souls knit close together,
strand by strand. Ellen could stand any
cruelty that he gave to her and condone it, but
she shivered back from this relentlessness that
she had seen in Roger. As he came to her she
said to him:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I heard you, Roger.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His face was still set in anger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I gave her no cause,&rdquo; he exclaimed angrily,
&ldquo;nothing but a little moonshine talk. When
we&rsquo;re married I shan&rsquo;t be subjected to things
like that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not going to be married,&rdquo; said Ellen.</p>



<p class="padtop"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>253]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>


<p>During all my life long I have occasionally
had, in times of stress, a recurrence of the
spiritual nausea which I felt that night. When
we drove home in the closed carriage Mrs.
Sylvester was prattling like a girl about the
beautiful party. Indeed, she had enjoyed the
outward circumstance of things almost more
than Ellen and myself, and Roger, making
light talk with her, sat next to Ellen,&mdash;light
talk that had its undercurrent of meaning that
Ellen and I understood. The cab lurched
noisily over the cobblestones, with which all
Boston was paved in those days, so that
Roger and Mrs. Sylvester had to raise their
voices above the din. It was raining, and the
yellow flare of the street-corner lamps was reflected
in pools of eddying light from the damp
pavements.</p>

<p>It seemed to me that we went on and on
forever in this torment of noise and talk, and
the smell of the wet spring night conflicted with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>254]</a></span>
the smell of the stuffy upholstery, and I suffered
as though I was witnessing the physical pain
of a tortured child. It seemed to me that the
torment of the ceaseless, agonizing prattle of
Ellen&rsquo;s little mother, accompanied by the
drunken lurch of the lumbering cab, would
never stop, for all the time I knew that Ellen&rsquo;s
heart was breaking, and that the only thing
that life could give her at that moment was
darkness and rest. I knew this was the end as
far as she and Roger were concerned.</p>

<p>We had our room together, and I felt like
a stranger in a house of mourning. I knew that
there was no comfort that I could give her
at all. She hadn&rsquo;t even tears with which to
refresh herself, and all she said to me was:
&ldquo;Roberta, I&rsquo;ve been stripped bare of leaves
to-night.&rdquo; This was a true enough picture of
her. She had been a blooming flower, and now
it was as if the frost of some inexorable and
unseen winter had touched her and she was
bare of leaves and blossoms.</p>

<p>I suppose I was the only one among all those
who loved her who did not urge Ellen to reflect
on her decision. There was so little to tell when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>255]</a></span>
it came to it. Ellen&rsquo;s reason was so little one
of the usual causes for which an engagement
may be dissolved, with the approval of a
girl&rsquo;s elders. Here was Ellen who had stood
by Roger gayly, without even, apparently, a
proper understanding of his dissipation; who
had endured from him neglect, who had learned
to school herself so that she was able to ignore
his temperamental interests in other women;
she, who had been without any end in her affections,
gave the appearance to the outside world
of having suddenly, for no reason, come to an
end of her love.</p>

<p>In our town there was scant belief that Ellen
had jilted Roger. Why do such a thing?
&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t they all as poor as church mice, and
isn&rsquo;t Roger as likely a young man as one would
wish to see?&rdquo; They clamored around me inquisitively.</p>

<p>There is no time when the human race shows
itself in such beauty and in such heartless sordidness
as in the time of grief. Then it is that
the world we know turns strange faces upon us,
and mean, low-lived men will show the gentle
chivalry that one would expect only of angels,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>256]</a></span>
and delicate women, of chaste and gracious
lives, will develop, before one&rsquo;s eyes, hideous
and ghoulish curiosity. Any one who has been
through the death of those whom they love
knows this, and still more it is true in the other
disasters of life, where there is no ceremonial
of grief. Death has dignity. Its august finality
stops many a wagging tongue and many an
unkind word. But oh, the other griefs of the
spirit! One is shielded by no mourning; there
is no protecting tradition to fold its arms about
one; and one&rsquo;s poor, shivering soul is left naked
on the highway, afraid of the heartless curiosity
of prying eyes.</p>

<p>The curious world has no mercy for a girl
jilted by her lover. There is no sanctity to all
this suffering, no privacy allowable, not a day&rsquo;s
respite from the inquisitive natures and prattling
tongues. One must count one&rsquo;s self very
fortunate if one is allowed to care for the most
bleeding of one&rsquo;s wounds with a certain degree
of decent privacy. And in our little town
privacy was what was impossible for Ellen.
I was for a while the center of the storm, for,
to Roger, Ellen had been inexplicable; he had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>257]</a></span>
not been able to believe what had happened
and came storming down after us.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see him,&rdquo; Ellen told me. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
no place anywhere in him to explain anything.
You&rsquo;ll see when you try and talk to him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I begged her, out of kindness, to see him once
because he was terribly torn by what had happened.
He told me that the sure foundations
of life had rocked under his feet, and when I
repeated this to Ellen, she shook her head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that,&mdash;he can&rsquo;t bear that what&rsquo;s
been so his creature should defy him. He&rsquo;s
never had life say no to him before.&rdquo; She said
this without bitterness, and more as an older
woman might of a boy she has brought up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why won&rsquo;t you see him,&rdquo; I pleaded with
her, &ldquo;just for one moment?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t dare to,&rdquo; she told me. &ldquo;Every
habit I have says yes to him; every strand of
my body cries out to him; it&rsquo;s as if he had never
been and I had died; and yet our bodies go on
living and caring for each other. He doesn&rsquo;t
need me any more than he needs any one else.
He needs no person, Roberta. Love and encouragement
and companionship: the world is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>258]</a></span>
full of it for him. Yet I need him and shall need
him always, to the end of my days.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Often it is that in the disintegration of a deep
and long-lived affection, it is the instinct of the
body to shiver away first, before the mind
knows what has happened, but it is more
dangerous when, in the full splendor of love,
the blow has fallen and instinct still clamors
for the beloved&rsquo;s companionship.</p>

<p>But she wasn&rsquo;t to be spared seeing him.
They met by chance upon the street. I was
with Ellen, and he began at once babbling
forth the excuses he had said over and over to
me. Because Ellen said there was no place in
him to tell him what it was all about, he persisted
in thinking that she had been outraged
by his trifling again, with their affection, at the
eleventh hour.</p>

<p>At last he went away, but he had the satisfaction
of feeling that he had played the noble
part. In the light of Ellen&rsquo;s actions, what he
considered his own small unfaiths, appeared
as nothing.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;Now you are gone [she wrote] I would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>259]</a></span>
call you back if I could, and I have to remember
and say to myself that there is no one to call
back. There is nothing in you that would hear
the things that I wish to say to you, and yet
you go on living and yet I must love you; and
yet, forever and ever in the night, my heart
goes out to you; and yet, when I walk along,
I feel the touch of your hand, as though it were
placed in mine. But the you that meant life
to me never was, or died, perhaps, with your
boyhood. He was there a little while and
smiled at me, and all the time the real you was
growing large and strong and killing that other
whom I loved. But I have bound my life up
in you, so what can I do, and where will I find
comfort? I can have scarcely the comfort of a
memory, for I have loved only a ghost in you.
I envy those sad and haggard girls who have
been deserted by their lovers. I envy wives
who have been left with little children to care
for, for they, at least, have had reality; they
have been able to give all of themselves, and
what they have known has been real. I wonder
if I shall always have to bleed for you, drop by
drop, and that while I bleed, my strength also
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>260]</a></span>
goes? Everything talks to me of you. My hand
stretches out for a pen and I must write to you,
though you aren&rsquo;t, and yet you are dearer to
me than all the world besides. Where did the
sweet soul of you go that I loved so well, and
how can I live in a world where such things
happen? I go out upon the street and hear
people walking past and children playing and
think with surprise, &lsquo;Why, there are happy
people in the world!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>



<p class="padtop"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>261]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>


<p>If the world has little pity for a jilted girl,
how shall it have much understanding for any
one who suffers after having voluntarily sent
her lover away, especially when it was her obvious
duty to her family to marry? So her world
was not very kind to Ellen at a moment when
she most needed their kindness. We do not
often understand the sicknesses of the spirit;
now we mete out to them the criminal indulgence
that a foolish woman does to a wayward
child, and now we treat them with bruising
harshness.</p>

<p>During the summer matters were not so bad,
because every one rather expected that Ellen
would come to herself. My grandmother used
to question me seriously if I were encouraging
Ellen.</p>

<p>Even Mr. and Mrs. Sylvester, most unworldly
people,&mdash;more unworldly, I think,
than any one I have ever known,&mdash;had seen
the children &ldquo;enjoying advantages&rdquo; through
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>262]</a></span>
Ellen, for Ellen and Roger had planned a thousand
things.</p>

<p>Matilda had wept openly when Ellen had returned,
and said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Ellen, Ellen! Now that you&rsquo;re not
going to be married, I suppose I shall never
visit you and study music in Boston, and, Ellen,
I had so make-believed it in my heart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>During the summer there was little written
in her journal except letters to Roger, which
stopped abruptly with her determination to
get over the aching want which she had for
him. With the coming of winter there settled
down over Ellen a limitless depression. She
was very gentle, but she seemed lost in a mist
of sadness. I cannot describe to what extent
her spirit was dimmed. It seemed as though
a strange, withering age had crept over her
before her time. People noticed it, and word
went abroad that Ellen Payne was &ldquo;in a decline,&rdquo;
which was a word for almost everything
that ailed one in those days, short of a
broken leg. I remember her walking around
at that time with poses of a very tired child,
for all the hollow under her eyes and the troubled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>263]</a></span>
lines in her forehead. She would let her
arms swing before her like a little girl that had
outgrown her strength, and throw herself down
into chairs as though she had held herself on
her feet to the utmost limits of her endurance.</p>

<p>I ventured to ask her at last: &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the
matter, Ellen?&rdquo; For we had avoided, by common
consent, talking of anything that might
be wounding, and had put the past out of sight.</p>

<p>She looked at me with eyes that had the
hurt look of a little girl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what&rsquo;s the matter,&rdquo; she told
me in answer. &ldquo;I know well enough what&rsquo;s
the matter. There&rsquo;s no meaning to life any
more at all. The world goes on over there&rdquo;&mdash;she
waved her hand ever so slightly&mdash;&ldquo;and
I&rsquo;m here on the outside, and what they do
doesn&rsquo;t mean anything at all, Roberta. If life
goes on like this, maybe I&rsquo;ll be lucky enough
to die, and the worst of it is that the hope of
dying is keeping me alive. I am afraid, Roberta,
that when one has anything to live for, even
if it&rsquo;s dying, that one keeps on living. What it
really means,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;is that I&rsquo;ve lost
God, for I can&rsquo;t pray any more.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>264]</a></span>
Since then I&rsquo;ve known a great many women
in mortal pain, and I truly believe that it is
the nearness of death that keeps many a suffering
soul alive. They are forever heartening
themselves by looking through the black, mysterious
door, where there is an end to pain and
where one need not stay famished any more at
life&rsquo;s feast. Death walks consolingly so close;
death is so easy and calls compassionately to
these forsaken ones, saying, &ldquo;Out here is rest&mdash;so
near; if it gets much worse, you can come
to me.&rdquo; Wherever one looks there is the consoling
possibility of death, and since death is
so near and so easy, people, who have forgotten
for a while the reason for living, go on
just the same. For who, in the winter of the
spirit, can again believe in spring?</p>

<p>At this time even the children seemed to
turn away from Ellen and give her nothing.
She had always meant laughter and gayety
and the heightening of the lives of all of us
around her, and Alec and I were the only two
who remained faithful to her in this moment of
desolation, because the others did not see Ellen
in this docile, lifeless soul, who went around
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>265]</a></span>
still called by the name of Ellen Payne; and
this withdrawal of human sympathy was as
unconscious as it was wounding. My sweet old
grandmother, who had loved Ellen so, combined
with old Mrs. Butler, whose hair Ellen
had done for years,&mdash;since Alec had grown
up,&mdash;would nod their heads together and say
that Ellen Payne ought to stop those mopish
ways and use more backbone.</p>

<p>That winter Ellen&rsquo;s mother was ailing and
coughed badly also, and for the first time in
her life was a little querulous and complaining.
I ignored as much as I could Ellen&rsquo;s ill feelings,
as she wished me to do, but I remember
this tragic winter well. There were a very few
entries in her journal, but not in this or in
any other crisis of her life had she failed to
clarify her mind by the written word. I find
this:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;I try as hard as I can to attach myself to
the duties that crowd around me. Sometimes
it just seems to me that I am going to succeed
in being interested and then I am not. I think
it must be like this in those strange northern
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>266]</a></span>
countries, where the glow of dawn comes on
the horizon, and, starved for light, one says,
&lsquo;Here is the dawn&rsquo;; and even as one speaks the
light pales and the dreadful twilight thickens
around one.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>Towards spring&mdash;one of those soppy, wet
springs, when it seems as though the green
would never come&mdash;I could stand the silence
no longer, and some word or look of hers that
betrayed to me the desolate abasement of her
spirit made me cry out:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ellen, isn&rsquo;t there anything on earth that
you want?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I would like to see Alec,&rdquo; she answered.</p>

<p>It seemed to me a foolish wish, for Alec was
in his first school and far away, and his visits
to us had been spasmodic and brief, and shared,
of course, with Elizabeth Greenough, though
during the summer he had been home and
spent a good deal of time with Ellen, and she
had accepted his kindness as she always had,
very much as the air one breathes, or as she
accepted my friendship&mdash;as one of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>267]</a></span>
certain things among the deep uncertainties of
life.</p>

<p>I wrote to Alec what Ellen had said, without
a hope in the world that he could come. It
seemed the sort of thing that only love accomplishes,
and he had seemed to me perfectly
contented with his engagement, making his
visits to the home of his young lady with the
regularity of a lover, or of a clock. But almost
sooner than seemed possible he came. When
Ellen saw him tears came to her eyes. For it is
just at these moments, when one is thirsting
for help and sympathy, that we seem to lose
the way to the hearts of others, and this is natural
enough, for there is a terrible egotism in
certain phases of grief. The eyes of the spirit
are turned inward and we cease to give, and
after a while, as with Ellen, grief becomes a
habit and we slip along smoothly enough in the
deepening and dolorous grooves of sorrow. It is
easier to do this where the outside life is monotonous,
and to us, in our little town, our own
point of view and our own spirits furnished
whatever diversity there was. One day went
along after another and one never met a new
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>268]</a></span>
face on the street, and it was with a true instinct
for help that Ellen cried out:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I envy men who can go out in the world
and forget. It must be easier to forget among
those who have never seen your face or ever
heard what has happened to you, and here
everything brings me back to the thoughts that
I try in so futile a fashion to put out of my
mind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alec&rsquo;s unexpected arrival had been the only
thing that had happened through the long
winter and spring. I waited with anxiety for
the end of their interview.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I asked Alec, &ldquo;how did you find her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>And he answered:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She just wants to know how one manages
to live when the meaning of life is dead and I
told her that that wasn&rsquo;t what she needed, but
that she needed to go and search for the meaning
of life, and you know, Roberta, a person
who really seeks for that can always find it.
I&rsquo;ve a plan that I&rsquo;m going to try. Ellen has
promised to do everything I tell her, and keep
her to it, even if it seems childish to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A day or two after Alec left, there knocked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>269]</a></span>
at the Sylvesters&rsquo; back door a sturdy boy of
twelve; a shock of wild black hair blew across
his forehead, and funny, humorous blue eyes
gleamed under straight black brows. For the
rest, he was freckled past belief. As Ellen
opened the door for him, he choked in a spasm
of embarrassment, then the words came, with
a rush. He had a deep voice for his age.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come to git Ellen Payne,&rdquo; he boomed.</p>

<p>When Ellen, who had opened the door for
him, said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, I&rsquo;m Ellen Payne and what do you
want?&rdquo; he flushed furiously and muttered:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He said you was a girl.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; responded Ellen, with more briskness
than she had shown for some time, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
a girl.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied the boy, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re a grown-up
woman, tall &rsquo;s ever you&rsquo;ll be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you say you had come to get me?&rdquo;
suggested Ellen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He said you was to come with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are we going to do?&rdquo; asked Ellen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Git mayflowers in a place you don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo;
said the boy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>270]</a></span>
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no such place,&rdquo; said Ellen. &ldquo;I
know every cranny of this place in my sleep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I know it as if I&rsquo;d <em>made it</em>,&rdquo; retorted
the boy.</p>

<p>By the time Ellen came back ready to walk,
a wave of shyness engulfed the boy; he was as
uncommunicative as the Pyramids. He was
deeply embarrassed by his companion, but he
forgot now and then enough to go ahead, shouting
his joy at the return of spring, and then his
gayety would fall as a flag at half-mast when
he saw Ellen after him. She came home wet
and very tired, to listen to the prophecy of her
Aunt Sarah that &ldquo;no good would come of this
weltering around in the wet, and that it was
just like one of Alec&rsquo;s unpractical thoughts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>While Miss Sarah loved Alec, his character
annoyed her, winding as it did around a
devious road and springing upon you new
view-points, as a supposedly quiet road might
discover unexpected and romantic vistas of
country. Especially his attitude toward the
boys was annoying to those who found difficulty
in having wood-piles replenished and the
&ldquo;chores&rdquo; done.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>271]</a></span>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;d think boys were something,&rdquo; my
grandmother used to explain with some heat,
&ldquo;besides trying, rascally, little scallywags; but
the older you grow, Roberta, the more you&rsquo;ll
find truth in what I say, and that is, that boys
were put in this world by the Lord for women
to exercise their patience over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tyke Bascom didn&rsquo;t come again for two
days. This time Ellen penetrated through the
shyness enough to find that he was a boy who
lived over the mountain-road in a little clearing,
called Foster&rsquo;s Corners, which had a sawmill
and four houses.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a long ways,&rdquo; said Ellen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not so long when you&rsquo;re used to it,&rdquo; he
replied. &ldquo;It might be long for a woman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In his walks over the mountain, Alec had
always stopped at the house and, being fatal to
small boys, Tyke had enrolled in the company
of Alec&rsquo;s friends. All that Tyke knew, it turned
out, he had been taught by Alec, as he sat there
resting on his way home.</p>

<p>For the next two weeks Tyke Bascom came
for Ellen, but irregularly. Sometimes he would
come each day, for two or three days, and once
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>272]</a></span>
three days went past, three days when Ellen
watched for him. It had been a long time since
she had been out in the open air; it had been a
long time since she had gone back to the places
she had known as a little girl, when she was in
that deep and almost mystic communion with
all life and growth around her, and when the
mountain and the river, and the small mountain
streams were like personalities to her. Only the
very pure in heart and children have this intimate
sense of oneness with the world, and Ellen
and Alec had lain for hours, under cover, and
watched to see a fox sneak past. They knew a
marsh where the blue heron lived, and when
she was little, Ellen had talked about the birds,
squirrels, and chipmunks as intimately as
though they were people.</p>

<p>Now all this forgotten lore came back to her
from out-of-the-way places in her mind. When
I was a girl, it was only too easy for people to
forget such things, for in my day, no sooner did
one grow up than the customs of young ladyhood
demanded that one should spend most
of one&rsquo;s time in the house. Even skating was
denied women, and Ellen&rsquo;s love of the outdoors
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>273]</a></span>
met with a steady stream of disapproval from
every one, including Roger. The only people
who had not frowned on her were her mother
and Mr. Sylvester, who held the heretical theory
that it was good even for a woman to know the
works of the Lord, even though a close and
intimate knowledge was bad for smoothness of
hair and neatness of frock.</p>

<p>More than that, there was a desire awakened
in Ellen&rsquo;s mind, of conquering this wild and
morose child, who had given his heart so unreservedly
to Alec.</p>

<p>She asked him,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you like going out with me, Tyke?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No &rsquo;m,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;not especially.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But&rdquo;&mdash;she told him&mdash;&ldquo;you don&rsquo;t need
to come if you don&rsquo;t want to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He flushed all over and said, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean
that. Don&rsquo;t you see, Alec told me to, so I don&rsquo;t
mind at all, &rsquo;cause it&rsquo;s for him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now I realize,&rdquo; she wrote, &ldquo;that whenever
I&rsquo;ve sat down anywhere children have always
come around me. Until the last year or two I&rsquo;ve
known all the little boys; there&rsquo;s never been a
time when some of Alec&rsquo;s youngsters haven&rsquo;t
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>274]</a></span>
been perched in our yard, and now comes along
this boy who takes me out with him as he would
carry a package for Alec.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was nothing for it, she must make him
her own. I think it was the first desire she had
had in a year&rsquo;s time, except the desire for the
ultimate peace. She wooed him first out of his
shyness, and as I would see them talking together
I would see all the mannerisms of the
Ellen I had known, of whom Aunt Sarah said,
&ldquo;She seemed about to burst into flame.&rdquo; All
her forgotten shy guiles that had led her before
into the inaccessible hearts of boys woke up one
by one. I don&rsquo;t know how far she went back on
the road to childhood, in these rambles, or how
much she remembered of the golden time when
Alec and she played truant together by the hills
and brooks.</p>

<p>One day Tyke appeared with this command:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You got to come up to my house, he says;
ma needs help, she&rsquo;s sick. He sent you this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He gave her a note from Alec which read:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear Ellen: It was always easier for you to
do housework out of your house than in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That was all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>275]</a></span>
&ldquo;Ma&rsquo;s sick; she&rsquo;s got a new baby.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So every day Ellen trudged over the mountain-road
and back. No sooner was Mrs. Bascom
beginning to be up and around again, and
Ellen still going to see her and the baby, than
Mrs. Sylvester hurt her foot a little and was
kept in her chair, so more than ever fell to Ellen.
She wrote:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;It is as though I had been walking down a
long corridor and suddenly had opened a door
into the light; when I came in sight of our house
to-night and thought of all the people who can
be happier because of me, tears of happiness
came to my eyes, and I should have been glad
if I could have gone down on my knees there
and thanked God that I was of use in the world
to those whom I love. All the selfish winter of
my heart melted and my mind went out to my
friend who helped me to find myself and to
bring me home again. I suppose this is the road
people have to travel to learn the meaning
of life. You hear a bird sing by the road and
you stop to listen, and by and by your heart
starts beating again.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>


<p>When Alec came back in the early summer,
he told me he was to stay for the year. The
academy had offered him a place in it, and so
had another school and he had chosen the
academy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t the other place better?&rdquo; I asked him.</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A little better; the experience is as good
here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We did not need to discuss why it was he had
stayed. I was a good enough friend of his to be
able to ask:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it fair to Elizabeth?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Roberta,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to give my
whole life to Elizabeth as long as it is of use to
her, but I have a right to give a year of it partly
to Ellen when she needs me.&rdquo; For his insight
into Ellen had told him that she needed a hand
out to her; during the moments of doubt and
moments of return to the dead center in which
she had lived so long.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>277]</a></span>
&ldquo;Seeing Ellen, and seeing her free, won&rsquo;t you
care more for her than you ought?&rdquo; I objected.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to get over it if I do. I&rsquo;ve thought
it out, Roberta. Nothing that I give Ellen
takes away from what I give Elizabeth. I care
for her just as much as I always did, and I&rsquo;ve
always cared for Ellen the same.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Alec!&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;why does the world
have to be so at cross-purposes? Why aren&rsquo;t
you free, and why can&rsquo;t you make Ellen care
for you? Are you sure that Elizabeth cares for
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not for me to think things like that
at all, Roberta,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;It would be a
poor sort of love I&rsquo;d bring to Ellen, wouldn&rsquo;t
it? I can&rsquo;t take kindness from Elizabeth and
wrap myself in the cloak of her sympathy when
I need it and throw it away when the sun comes
out, even had the unimaginable happened, and
Ellen cared for me,&mdash;which she won&rsquo;t. Some
faiths one has to keep with one&rsquo;s self.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As for Ellen, she accepted Alec&rsquo;s companionship
as a matter of course. She had no doubts
at all about Alec&rsquo;s devotion to Elizabeth, for
Elizabeth was one who compelled sweetness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>278]</a></span>
when one spoke of her. She was a little person,
appealing and soft, and the sort of woman who
attends to the physical wants of the man she
loves so kindly that this devotion is almost
spiritual. It never occurred to Ellen that she
still held any place in Alec&rsquo;s heart or that his
early affection for her had been anything more
than a boyish devotion he had outgrown for a
real love. I think through the autumn and long
winter, they both lived in the radiance of their
affection for one another; they two were in the
light together and the past and future were shut
out. Perhaps they were better friends that they
were not lovers. They both lived like children
in the present, neither one looking into the
future, when Alec should no longer be hers, but
another woman&rsquo;s.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s good [she wrote] to have something
that lasts in one&rsquo;s life. Never for a moment, in
all that I&rsquo;ve lived through, has my affection
faltered for Alec, nor his for me. We have
each of us had more absorbing loves than each
other, but this steady little flame remains unquenched.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>279]</a></span>
I think in their mutual satisfaction and the
consciousness of their own virtue, they did not
realize, as high-minded people often do, how
this flowering friendship might affect a smaller
nature. Elizabeth grew restless under it, and
Miss Sarah found out from gossiping people
that Elizabeth had not scrupled to do what was
little short of spying on Alec.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope,&rdquo; she said to Ellen, &ldquo;that you&rsquo;re
worldly wise enough not to make trouble. Of
course, we know that Alec might as well be your
brother, but a young woman in love can&rsquo;t be
expected to realize it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alec was supremely unaware of any discontent
on Elizabeth&rsquo;s part; he went over to see
her as regularly as he had come home while he
was in college, and whatever she felt she kept
to herself. I fancy that Alec, whimsical and
humorous, large-hearted and kind, would have
been hard to approach with a small jealousy.
Once in the light of his smile it would have
withered up.</p>

<p>It was after more and more of this talk had
come to Ellen that I find, for the first time, in
her journal a note of emotion about Alec.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>280]</a></span>
&ldquo;When I hear them tell all the little things
she does against you, Alec, my heart weeps, for
if she&rsquo;s like that, I must watch you start out on
a road of long disillusionment. It&rsquo;s so hard to
sit aside and watch sadness and even disgust
grow in your eyes, that my heart is heavy, and
with unshed tears. What will happen to you
whose goodness has come out to meet the goodness
in me all your life? Either your own goodness
will burn up the you that loves her, or the
you that loves her will eat and corrode the you
I love. I hope for you the high unhappiness
and the sad and hard-gained peace rather than
the contented compromise with the little, mean
virtues that act as anodynes. Whatever happens
to the outward aspect of your life, I wish for
you that your spirit may walk free; but oh! I
shan&rsquo;t be there to help you in the hard places,
I shan&rsquo;t be able to hold out my hand to you
as yours has been held out to me.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>It was only when she realized that Alec was
going out into a life fraught with difficulties
for him, since he loved a woman who had it in
her power to hurt him so, that Ellen looked at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>281]</a></span>
the future, empty of her friend. From this
time her journal is full of Elizabeth. From a
woman to be taken for granted, some one sweet
whom Alec loved, she became a sinister menace.
In her little soft person she carried the unhappiness
of what had been sweetest in Ellen&rsquo;s life.</p>



<p class="padtop"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>282]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>


<p>There came a beautiful spring month where
she put the thought of the future from her, for
Elizabeth was away on a visit and Ellen could
forget her. Alec might have gone to his very
wedding-day without Ellen knowing her very
own mind and realizing that the dear and long-tested
affection had changed its name; and only
after he left her would she have wept at the
grief of her heart, and, indeed, to me, a close
observer, it did not seem to change its complexion
at all, and not until the day of Alec&rsquo;s
accident was I, a constant third in their party,
conscious of any change in them.</p>

<p>You know how disaster fills the air of a little
town as a spiritual thunderclap. I remember to
this day the sinister feeling I had that something
was wrong when I saw two women meet
two others in front of my house and stop, talking
and gesticulating. I remember the flash
that went over me was, &ldquo;I wonder what&rsquo;s
happened&rdquo;; and then a patter of bare feet and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>283]</a></span>
a little flying figure of a lad dashed past, and
they would have stopped him, but he made a
wild circle around them, crying as he went:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alec Yorke&rsquo;s dead!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then I went out and became one of the gesticulating
women. Then came the doctor driving
from the school; he was waylaid up the
street, and we scurried along, young and old, to
hear what had happened. It seemed there had
been some sort of a boy&rsquo;s prank with some gunpowder,
and Alec, pulling away a boy, had been
hurt. No, he wasn&rsquo;t dead, but there was a
question of his eyesight; one couldn&rsquo;t tell how
badly injured he was until the next day. That
was all there was to tell. He was resting quietly.
Then there was the rattle of wheels, and I
saw Ellen driving down the street. She came
straight toward us, but she was so drowned
in the dolorous contemplation of what had happened
that I am sure she did not see us, though
at the sight of her face we all turned silent
and stared at her; and the doctor dropped an
illuminating word:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s going to get Alec&rsquo;s young lady. Coming
to he was rambling on about her, and&rdquo;&mdash;he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>284]</a></span>
hesitated&mdash;&ldquo;if the worst should happen it
would be a comfort to have her there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But I, who knew Ellen so well, knew at the
sight of her face what it was that had happened
to her, and an impulse so deep in me that the
words sprang to my lips involuntarily made
me cry out, &ldquo;Ellen, stop. I&rsquo;m going with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She obeyed me mechanically, but she seemed
almost unconscious of me as I got in beside her.
It was one of those days in spring when the
world seems sodden with tears; when every
tree drips all the day long. I remember to this
day how I felt as I sat there by Ellen&rsquo;s side,
fighting back tears until I was sick, for the hopeless
tragic tangle of life had overwhelmed me. I
wanted to cry with the oblivion of grief that
unhappily one seldom knows this side of childhood.
It seemed to me that some hidden well
of sorrow had been opened from which the tears
must gush forth unquenchable. And yet I must
not cry, since Ellen sat there like something
turned into stone. It was an irony too cruel to
be borne that she should drive over this road
to bring this alien Elizabeth to Alec.</p>

<p>I knew, as though she had herself told me so,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>285]</a></span>
that all life could give her no such sweetness as
the right to comfort Alec in his moment of trial,
and that life had never given her anything
harder than to go seeking another woman to
fill the place that she would have been glad
to fill herself. And with the same clearness of
vision I knew that it was Ellen for whom Alec
had called. At the moment of his disaster the
old comfortable myth of friendship had ceased,
and then Ellen had known that for her Alec
was the very foundation of life, woven into its
fabric, and that he had always been there. And
this knowledge had come so flooding, so overwhelming
that it drowned her and with it came
the necessity of seeking a stranger for him.</p>

<p>The interminable wet and weeping road over
the mountain swarmed with memories of Alec;
with the ghosts of the Alec and ourselves of
bygone days. It was up this road that we had
walked to meet him through that long and difficult
winter, and the really glad spots of life
were his home-coming. What did &ldquo;over the
mountain&rdquo; mean, anyway, but Alec? And yet
here we were going upon this errand; nor could
I have opened my lips to say a word against it,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>286]</a></span>
even though I was innerly certain it was Ellen,
and not Elizabeth, Alec wanted, for I was
bound down by the fierce and narrow-minded
code which decreed that, while a woman might
refuse a marriage with a man, a man must go
through to the bitter end. I had permitted myself
one protest and repented of it. As we go on
we will throw away all the false loyalties that
have crucified so many of us.</p>

<p>Both Ellen and myself faced this as though
it was as inevitable as death itself. I do not
know how fully she realized what she was doing;
I do not know, but I cannot believe that
deep down in her heart she thought that Alec
didn&rsquo;t care for her. But she had played the
game of friendship with Alec too long and too
well to think that he gave her anything else
but friendship. So we drove, silent, over our
beloved road and down the other side of the
mountain into the village street whose elms
dripped unceasingly, and up to Elizabeth&rsquo;s
white, commonplace little house.</p>

<p>There was an added irony to it all in the way
she received us in her parlor. She was the type
of girl who preserves under all circumstances
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>287]</a></span>
the little punctilios of life. She didn&rsquo;t permit
herself the indiscretion of one surprised look at
the sight of our strained faces and our arrival
in the midst of a slow-falling, implacable spring
rain. It was impossible not to avoid the polite
overtures of an ordinary call. If we had come
on an important errand it was plain that we
should have to make the opening for the telling
of that errand ourselves. She was very polite
to us, but her politeness hid a mild resentment,
for we had represented in life all of Alec that
she had never been able to possess; while to us
Elizabeth, so pretty in her commonplace way,
so decorous, represented the menace of Alec&rsquo;s
happiness.</p>

<p>For a moment we bandied polite phrases,
or rather Elizabeth and I did, while Ellen sat
inert and aloof as she had on the drive over,
until all of a sudden she seemed to awaken in
a gush of pity for Alec and for Elizabeth. She
swept all the little politenesses out of the way
with one gesture.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Elizabeth,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;you must put on
your things and come with us. Alec&rsquo;s been
hurt. His eyesight is perhaps in danger.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>288]</a></span>
There was something deeply sweet in the
way she spoke and deeply sweet in the look she
gave Elizabeth, and at her complete sincerity
and goodness Elizabeth also dropped the politenesses
that she was using as a shield against us.
The tears that were so easy for her started to
her eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Ellen!&rdquo; she cried; &ldquo;oh, poor Alec!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d better go, I think, Elizabeth,&rdquo; said
Ellen gently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t go,&rdquo; Elizabeth answered; &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
go with you, Ellen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And to the amazed question of our looks:
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t go because I care for some one else,&rdquo;
she told us. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d have written to him before,&rdquo;
she went on, &ldquo;but I thought I&rsquo;d let him wait.
He&rsquo;d let me wait long enough.&rdquo; There was
neither spite nor bitterness in her tone as she
said this. I think the very best of her came
forward to meet us in this moment. At the
root of her narrow little nature was a certain
childlike candor. &ldquo;I cared for him too long
without having him ever care. I tried to be real
patient, but I got tired after a while, Ellen, and
it seems good to me to have the whole heart
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>289]</a></span>
of a man.&rdquo; And then a light whiff of anger
flamed up in her. &ldquo;Why did you come for me
anyhow, Ellen Payne,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;when he
might need you? You knew all the time it was
you he cared for; you knew all the time it was
you he wants! Now hurry, hurry back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The conventionalities had fallen from her,
and for the first and last time we saw the Elizabeth
for whom Alec had cared.</p>

<p>With this godspeed we started on our long
drive back, I full of disquieting fears, full of
anguish concerning Alec; Ellen still and withdrawn.
After a while the strain of silence told
on me and the words forced themselves from
my lips: &ldquo;Oh, I can&rsquo;t bear to think of its happening.
I can&rsquo;t bear to think of having his
life hurt this way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As if recalled from a very far distance, Ellen
turned her head to me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t happen, Roberta,&rdquo; said she slowly.</p>

<p>I looked at her curiously. There was just
enough light for me to see the outline of her
face, and I felt as if she had pulled herself back
by some great effort to answer me and that her
spirit had been somewhere with Alec, free for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>290]</a></span>
the first time. And I felt for the rest of the
ride as if in some obscure way he were near us;
that Ellen could call to him through the dark.</p>

<p>His mother opened the door for us.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;ve come,&rdquo; she said with her
profound simplicity. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s wanted you all
his life, Ellen Payne.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So we three women sat ourselves down for
the night watch to learn what the morning
would bring. Alec&rsquo;s mother sat there, her hands
folded, solid as a rock, impassive as fate. She
had borne a great deal in her life and had grown
strong with it, and whatever happened she
would be there to help him. All through my
life I shall remember Ellen&rsquo;s face as it was
through that long night, for it was the face of
one who defies death and disaster; and what I
mean only those who have brooded guardingly
over the lives of those whom they love will
understand. For there comes a moment in the
lives of most women and some men when they
seem to put their spirits, a tangible thing, between
death and disaster and the beloved.</p>

<p>And one more thing I shall remember forever
was Alec&rsquo;s voice, as he cried out in his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>291]</a></span>
sleep, &ldquo;Ellen,&rdquo; and again, &ldquo;Ellen,&rdquo; as though,
sunk fathoms deep in pain, he still called for
her and his unconscious body groped for her
in the darkness. So we sat and waited through
the night, until the blessed word came to us at
last that all was well with him.</p>

<p>There was only one more entry in the journal
and then blank leaves, for I suppose she began
another book that belonged to herself and Alec
alone. It told of the accident and went on:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;I felt as if I had been waiting for this one
moment all my life; as if all I had ever been and
could hope to be concentrated itself in those
long hours; as though the arms of my spirit
folded themselves around him as I prayed, and
as I prayed I knew that my prayer had been
answered. I was as certain that it was well with
him as if I could penetrate into the future.
And that night I knew the meaning of my long
life, and that I had only been learning to love
enough, so that when he called to me, &lsquo;Ellen,
Ellen,&rsquo; I should have learned how to love and
how to give.&rdquo;</p>

Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who

things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
